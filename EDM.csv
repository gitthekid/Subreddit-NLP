I think there's a lot to dissect about the album, so I think it's worthy of its own post and having a full review. Hope you enjoy!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Long review warning:**

I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to have been listening to this album for several months now, so I‚Äôve had time to collect my thoughts. But I think I can confidently say this: "".wav"" is simply put, Flux Pavilion‚Äôs best body of work he‚Äôs ever released.

‚Äú.wav‚Äù is consistent, cohesive, creative, and includes his most well-produced songs yet. This was a massive departure for Josh, as fans have come to expect that ‚Äòclassic Flux dubstep sound‚Äô that we‚Äôve all heard and loved the past decade. But he‚Äôs stated a few times now that he was so tired of making that style, and felt he could do so much more. And as of recently, he‚Äôs even said [‚ÄúI am no longer a dubstep person‚Äù](https://twitter.com/Fluxpavilion/status/1348769729218011137). I can already see this will be an issue for several of his hardcore fans, as their first thought will be that he‚Äôs ‚Äòselling out‚Äô or ‚Äòlost his touch‚Äô. But hopefully they‚Äôll recognize that it‚Äôs actually the other way around - this is the most true-to-himself release Flux Pavilion has ever had. And not to mention that several songs on this album absolutely keep elements of Flux‚Äôs core sound.

The best comparison I can give is that "".wav"" is to Flux Pavilion as what ‚ÄúVisceral‚Äù is to Getter -- as in an album filled with a sound different than the dubstep genre they were known for, but includes their most creative &amp; well-made tunes yet. I know Getter had some massive backlash after that album came out -- so much so that he cancelled his tour and essentially was bullied back into making heavy songs again. I am crossing my fingers that this doesn‚Äôt happen to Flux Pavilion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As far as each individual tracks, here‚Äôs my thoughts:

1) Every Cable Goes Somewhere

- Man what a way to start the album. I love the spacey atmosphere the song creates - I even get a little [‚ÄúClose Encounters Of The Third Kind‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yIp2huYgD8) vibe during the intro. The rest of the track is filled with some awesome textured and crunchy percussion &amp; synths layered luxuriously. Out of every song on the album, this is definitely the one that most sounds extremely Flume-inspired, but I don‚Äôt mind that at all - especially since Flux‚Äôs classic sound is still buried in there. One of the biggest bangers of the album that I keep returning to.

2) Survive

- Definitely one of the more upbeat/pop-ier tracks on the album. Certainly very catchy, and that bridge is heavenly (so godly it got slowed down as an interlude for the track, ‚ÄúBreathe‚Äù). Love that vocal effect before the second drop too. I will say I was expecting a lot more for a collab with Feed Me - hopefully they collab again and we get some darker sounds. It just kind of sounds like what a Marshmello song would sound like if it was good.

3) 20:25

- Such an epic track. The synth plucks and groove are on point. I get a nostalgic feel from this one too. It‚Äôs just a perfect balance of Flux &amp; WSN‚Äôs sounds, which I think is what makes collaborations great. I think they managed to make a fresh funky midtempo track, and I hope they make more like this.

4) Lion‚Äôs Cage

- Definitely one of the most ballad-like tracks on the album. I like the slower vibe that gives the lead and Nevve‚Äôs vocals more room to breathe. This one doesn‚Äôt really blow me away at all, especially since the drop doesn‚Äôt feel like anything too original - there‚Äôs lots of future bass tracks like it. That being said, I love the break and outro, which are so cinematic. Maybe Flux will score a movie sometime?

5) Partial Fugue In B Minor

- Ho-ly--shit. I have no idea what he was thinking when he made this track but I hope he keeps on doing whatever it is. This is flat-out one of the most creative tracks on the album, or even in his discography in general. The classic melody intertwined with the classic flux bass is a match made in heaven. This track just sucks you in in such a way I can‚Äôt describe, it‚Äôs just got such a good energy. Probably my favorite track on the album (or tied with ‚ÄúI Will Stay‚Äù).

6) Sink Your Teeth In

- This track didn‚Äôt seem to get a very good reception when it was released, but I think it deserves so much more. While it‚Äôs not one of my top favorites on the album, it certainly evokes a ‚Äòfuture classic‚Äô feeling (in the literal sense, not the music label). It‚Äôs probably the biggest ‚Äòanthem‚Äô of the album, and it‚Äôs probably my favorite hook on it as well. If this gets enough play, I can envision festival crowds chanting and swaying to this one. And then of course the 2nd drop, which feels like a festival closer moment. And once again he nails it on the outro - a moment that evokes pure introspection. That all being said, the drops do feel a little empty - I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs missing though.

7) I Believe

- Easily the ‚Äòtrap‚Äô-iest song on "".wav"". Though not necessarily ‚Äòa banger‚Äô, it‚Äôs certainly one of the heaviest tracks. I think the buildup sections are really strong, with the synths increasing like a warning bell. Which then make the drop impossible not to bop your head to. Ngl I had some stank face the first time I heard this one. The bright vocals are a fairly big contrast from the instrumental, which makes it an interesting listen. Josh explained the story behind the lyrics on this one on the listening party stream - though a little corny, he essentially explained it as a love story between a human and alien - which absolutely fits the album‚Äôs theme.

8) Twitterbird

- Definitely one of the more interesting tracks on the album. I love the vocal chops and guitar on this track the most. Though it may not be the most original-sounding song - mainly because it sounds exactly like San Holo - the way the song came together is certainly original. Flux had fans send in vocal clips for the album through Twitter - where he said hundreds came through. He then used tons of these to create the vocal chops - making it sound almost like a birdsong (hence, ‚ÄòTwitterbird‚Äô). I recommend watching [this video to learn more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG3cGO9rOpw)

9) Breathe

- The only interlude on the album, but it‚Äôs a nice break from the rest. Though not too complex, it‚Äôs so relaxing. The pace is almost like a heartbeat. Plus the slowed down vocals from the bridge of ‚ÄúSurvive‚Äù sound even better on this one. Even if not the most special, I do see the value of including interludes on albums, and I wish he‚Äôd included at least 1 more. Some tracks that didn‚Äôt make it on the album (i.e. ‚ÄúFretless‚Äù and ‚ÄúCrying At Night‚Äù) I think could have served this purpose well.

10) You &amp; I

- Another ‚Äòanthem‚Äô-type track from the album. I could see this one getting some radio play as well. There‚Äôs nothing I dislike about this track, but there‚Äôs not much I have to say about it either. Compared to the rest of "".wav"", there‚Äôs not too much special on this one. The melodic drops with a little classic flux mixed in I think works even better on some of the other songs. Though the vocals are nice, the lyrics are totally meh -- I‚Äôve heard 1000 other songs with hooks like this one.

11) Symphony

- Crazy that this track came out 3 years ago! Yet it doesn‚Äôt feel out of place. ‚ÄúSymphony‚Äù marked the very beginning of the "".wav"" era - where Josh decided he wanted to try some new directions rather than making the same dubstep song he‚Äôd made before. It‚Äôs definitely the slowest track on the album, but it definitely makes a statement in its sound. The swing-type pace makes it pretty funky/folksy.

12) Fall To Me

- I would say this song is the only one that would qualify as a pure ‚Äòclassic flux dubstep banger‚Äô. He seemed to have avoided this type of sound on the rest of the album, so it kind of sticks out. But it‚Äôs certainly enjoyable with all its melodic elements mixed in. Chime‚Äôs signature style makes the drops so youthful &amp; fun. The track sounds like something Virtual Riot would make/love/play, and I bet his hardcore fans will adore this one.

13) I Will Stay

- Just pure wow. This one is truly something special. Probably my favorite track on the album. Please give me more songs like this Flux. ‚ÄúI Will Stay‚Äù is simply a modular journey. I can‚Äôt really describe all of my thoughts about this one - you just have to give it a listen. But I will say that the analog synths sound better here than on anything else he‚Äôs ever made. For one - it‚Äôs nearly 7 minutes long - much longer than every other track on the album (or that he‚Äôs ever released). While some see this a negative, I think it absolutely works in his favor. Each minute gives time for the melodies &amp; counter melodies to evolve and progress. It‚Äôs tracks like this that remind you that Flux Pavilion isn‚Äôt your typical ‚Äòlemme whip up FL Studio and drag in some presets‚Äô-type of producer. He is a complex modular maniac. I really enjoyed watching him this year in quarantine messing with his giant analog machines - reminded me a lot of deadmau5. The last thing I‚Äôll say about this one is that it very much reminded me of [‚ÄúSays‚Äù by Nils Frahm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIwwjy4slI8). I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a good thing or a bad thing, but that‚Äôs one of my all-time favorite electronic songs, so I‚Äôm curious if he was inspired by it.

14) Somebody Else

- This is probably the song that best represents the album as a whole. It‚Äôs got everything - enticing intro, upbeat &amp; catchy vocal performance, melodic yet heavy drop that mixes his old style with his new style, etc. I absolutely adore the intro too - the distorted orchestral strings make it feel like a bittersweet memory, like on [‚ÄúBitter Sweet Symphony‚Äù by The Verve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lyu1KKwC74). Definitely one that‚Äôs gotten a ton of play from me.

15) Endless Fantasy

- Though far from being one of my favorites on the album, this song helps wrap up "".wav"" nicely. It just sounds like a concert encore. I also wanted to give Josh‚Äôs vocals a shoutout on the latter part of the track - probably his best vocal moment in his discography so far. But overall the song just feels a little boring and drags on a bit too long.

16) LOVE

- I can‚Äôt think of a better closer for an album like this. The gentle guitar, strings, and background vox are like a big hug at the end of an adventure. This track evokes a lot of mental imagery - you can picture the space fantasy so well. And when those synths &amp; drums come in, it‚Äôs epic. I‚Äôd say this is very comparable to ‚ÄúGoodbye To A World‚Äù by Porter Robinson. At the end section when all the sounds come together in one giant build/drop, it‚Äôs pure euphoria. All with 1 simple message - love. Might be cliche but it works here. Plus that outer-worldly outro is just perfect. It‚Äôs easily the most emotional song on the album, and I just can‚Äôt imagine anyone not enjoying it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, this album exceeded my expectations and made me think of Flux Pavilion in a different way - and that‚Äôs all I could‚Äôve ever asked for. Clearly he‚Äôs got what it takes to do so much more than the same routine dubstep sound he‚Äôs known for. Aside from being other genres, this album is the best example of his artistry for him doing more than using a DAW - he sings, he plays guitar, and he has some awesome analog work. Speaking of guitar, I don‚Äôt think his lovely guitar work is getting enough appreciation. Definitely deserves a shoutout.

All this being said, "".wav"" is not flawless. Though not an exclusive complaint to this album specifically, one critique I have is that I wish it didn‚Äôt have so many singles. Only like 5 tracks were not previously released. I think it would have made the album listening experience much more enjoyable had I not known what was coming next. Thankfully my favorites from this album were not the singles (Every Cable, Partial Fugue, and LOVE). I also think the album‚Äôs sequencing could have been improved. Though Every Cable was the obvious choice for opener and LOVE the obvious choice for the closer, the flow of songs in between could have been better. It just kind of seemed a little random, when I think in terms of vibe/key/storytelling, it could have been ordered a better way.

Though 16 songs/1 hour of music seems to be the perfect length, I was craving even more. This includes wondering what happened to ‚ÄúSaviour‚Äù and ‚ÄúSurrender‚Äù, which were both singles for this album. But it also includes some other unreleased tracks that would have fit perfectly on the album. One example is ‚ÄúSquall &amp; Rinoa‚Äù, a 3 minute quirky yet beautiful interlude that was a like a reprise of part of the melody from ‚ÄúPartial Fugue‚Äù. It sounds like something off of a classic Nintendo soundtrack.  However, seeing him create these songs on his Twitch the past year or so was so satisfying - I highly recommend following him on there. He‚Äôs already made a whole album‚Äôs worth of songs since finishing "".wav"" (Dreadlegs, The Prophet, etc.), so hopefully it won‚Äôt be too long since we get to hear more.

I‚Äôm curious what the upcoming live show entails - whether it‚Äôll just be singing/playing guitar over the album or whether it‚Äôll be live versions of the songs like in Worlds Live. Either way I can‚Äôt wait to hear all these songs together in a live atmosphere.

On one final note, I just wanted to also give a shoutout for the album cover. I mean, THAT ALBUM ARTWORK, WOW! It‚Äôs just beautiful and unique and perfectly evokes the sound of "".wav"".

The Top 50 will be added once they've been announced

I tried to include as many extendeds as possible, if not the radio edits will be included, or when an extended mix was played as a mix cut and is not covered by much vocal cues, that will be used.(P.S. can you guess which producer has the least extended mixes?)

Also sadly there are some missing tracks still.
In this case, if there is a mix cut, the mix cut will be added. When even the mix cut is not available
but it's a remix, the original will have been added instead.

Missing tracks.

52,Share your favorite playlists or songs here,"If you enjoy iLLENIUM, Seven Lions, Madeon, future bass, or anything like that I‚Äôd like to share my playlist with you. 

It‚Äôs full of positive energy and certified bangers and it‚Äôs called Lovestep, which is what I think of as the chill / emotional head banging cousin of dubstep.

I curate this playlist constantly to ensure that your vibe check is passed: every song mf slaps and brings good vibes only. Put it on in the background or turn it up full blast. 

You don‚Äôt have to like it, I‚Äôll be happy if you find one artist or song that you have never heard of and enjoy. 

Or don‚Äôt listen to it. Maybe you‚Äôd rather headbang or dance to house or techno and get real figgity with some weird shit but that‚Äôs cool. I love that shit, especially like when an absolutely filthy drop just gives you permanent stank face. Yeah. Anyway, this is more of a chill, sad boi hour type playlist. 

I‚Äôm guessing we like the same type of music, so you can understand why this is my playlist I listen to when I‚Äôm chilling in my room high as a kite, forever feeling my blanket because it‚Äôs so damn soft, and loving life because everything is dope and music soothes my soul. 


Hit me up with your favorite playlists or songs, I‚Äôm open to all kinds of music. Much love

87,Favourite Lyric,"So many EDM songs are made together by there lyrics and wouldn't be complete. There's lots of classic songs and many great lyrics. I want to know what your fave lyrics are from a song. 

So choose one line or one paragraph from that song.
I love high on life by Martin Garrix so I'd use lyrics from there like:

 I just live a fast life
Forget about the past time
Numb out to escape my feels
And friendships only pass by
Show up, gone, like strobe lights
With you, I feel something real

Or another example would be Coone - universal language

For all of us comes a time
To open our eyes and face reality
To acknowledge the fact that..
Things might not always be just the way that we want them to be
Or turn out the way that we want them to turn out
And that the course of life will leave its mark upon all of us

Hahah, you know what I'm talking about?
We can either choose to stay alone and go our own way
Or search for like-minded souls with common interests just like ourselves
Cause it is what binds us that makes us as one
The synergy of forces combined, growing in numbers every day
Spoken and understood around the world
In the north, east, south, west

Music is our universal language

102,2020 EDM scene recap,"March 2020 will be a date many of us will remember as last time we attended a concert in 2020, the last time we were able to dance in a  crowd among total strangers and didn't have to wear a mask, the last  time we could come within 6 ft of our favourite artists for a Meet &amp;  Greet and take a selfie with them, and the last time we picked out the outfit we were planning to wear for the rave happening the next day.

By mid March, venues across the world were ordered by governments to close and upcoming festivals we all were looking forward to this year  had to be postponed. With no live events happening for the foreseeable future, artists and promoters were forced to find new ways to connect with fans and safely entertain them, and they did so by hosting livestreams  on Twitch, Facebook, Youtube, or some other platform. Instead of  spending 3 days at a festival, we would now spend weekends in our  bedrooms decorated by colourful sound activated lights, dressed up in our rave clothes, and dancing as hard as we could just to get that old feeling back.

2020 was a time for people to reflect on their lives and realize what their priorities are. For years, many of our favourite artists have only known a life of being jet lagged, partying non-stop, neglecting self-care, and being away from their family and loved ones for most of  the year.  It was a year for artists to relax and spend time with loved ones or lock themselves in their studios to create some unforgettable music that would get us through quarantine.

2020 was a wild year for EDM and I thought it would be worth recapping just some of the things we all saw during it:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Live events were replaced by livestreams, virtual festivals, and drive-ins
2. Livestreams supporting charities raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for important causes
3. Every DJ now has a Twitch channel, Discord server, or Tik Tok account
4. Insomniac hosted some amazing weekend livestreams
5. Ultra stiffed its customers by not offering refunds for Ultra Miami 2020 which had to be postponed
6. ""Wax Motif - Keep Raving"" became the anthem for quarantine
7. Minecraft became the new Coachella
8. ""PLAMP"" became everybody's new favourite word
9. Artists made EDM edits of Cardi B's hit song W.A.P
10. Burning Man took place in VR
11. David Guetta took first place in the DJ Mag Top 100 DJs poll ending the 5 year streak previously held by Garrix and DVLM
12. Kaskade became the first DJ to perform at The Grand Canyon
13. Some very well-known and wealthy DJs awkwardly asked fans to reach  into their wallets to donate money to support their tour managers who  are struggling to make ends meet due to COVID
14. Pop singer Katy Perry headlined Tomorrowland Around the World and  H.P. Baxxter of Scooter made a guest appearance during DVLMs set to  close out the festival
15. Pendulum released new music after a decade
16. The Glitch Mob's iconic Drink The Sea album turned 10 years old
17. JOYRYDE and Tchami finally released their debut albums
18. Excision announced his new record label Subsidia Records and  released 100+ tracks spread across three volumes in a single day
19. One word: Polyriddim
20. Faithless released a brand new album after five years
21. Ti√´sto announced a new Deep House alias called VER:WEST
22. Actor Vin Diesel made a Tropical house track
23. Noisia's farewell tour had to be postponed due to the pandemic
24. We had to say goodbye to some industry legends: Florian Schneider of  Kraftwerk, Dubstep legend Cookie Monsta, the young American rising Techno star i\_o, and Phil K just to name a few
25. Dutch electronic music duo DROELOE split up after five years
26. Marshmello's $350,000 truck got stolen
27. DJs had to bid the popular music download gate ""TheArtist Union"" farewell

129,Is there actual animosity between fans of particular genres?,"I've worked the industry in South Beach, Chicago, NY, and LA over the years, but never have I ever seen such animosity between genres over the ~1-2 years.

Right before covid, I hosted a pregame for a big show downtown LA.  My fiancee put on one of my sets (she's great :D) and we were all bopping along until I, apparently, made a mistake.  I had been playing some trance and switched into techno and, I kid you not, one of the girls there straight up said ""ummmm you can't play techno and trance in the same set"".  At first half of us just chuckled, but that launched her into a tirade about how ""in LA"" trance lovers don't get along with techno; her friends weren't mean about it, but they agreed.  To me, it seemed like a dislike for trance rather than a love for techno, however...

Since then, the animosity has become ubiquitous online.  One meme after another about ""sub genres"" and people arguing over what's what.

For me, EDM has always been about PLUR and letting people do their own thing.  I would truly be crushed if we came back and the scene was splintered to hell.

It used to be the spinning records type edm stuff if i recall correctly. My guess was that Excision was somehow involved with the revival of dubstep and it becoming a huge part of the festival scene in the USA.

However im from Australia where it‚Äôs still pretty small, although growing. Some reason its just house thats big and hardstyle in the sydney area. So i wasnt there to witness the rapid growth of dubstep (or it might have been gradual for all i know tbh. 

Btw i wish it was as huge here in Australia. It barely ever makes it in our big festivals. However we do have a sort of underground scene in a few states so im grateful for that.",EDM,1608821063,Garnservo97,8,1,True,2020-12-24

146,Tips for Genre Blends/Long DJ sessions of EDM,"Hello fellow music lovers :)

I recently as of 4 weeks ago have been graved with a weekly residency with ""EDM"" Music.  I love all sorts of sub genres that range anywhere from G-House to dirty filthy Dub/Bro Step.

&amp;#x200B;

For this weekly ordeal i tend to play more crowd pleasers to help satisfy the bars desire to bring in more local clients that are just walking by the establishment.; With this i have primarily played/book other DJ's that focus on House/Bass House, Trap and ""mainstream"" Dubstep.

&amp;#x200B;

Because these events are 4 hours long each week I, of course like most, want to keep it regularly fresh (mostly for my sanity). Can some one recommend some great sub genres for crowd pleasers and over all ""bangers"".  


I am slowly building the cliental to expect more specific genres such as dubstep, space bass, half step etc etc. But till then, i need some more Genres/Artists and tracks that blend more commonly with a crowd that is less EDM influenced. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any and all tips and experiences is appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!

personal prefference: high pitch tend sounds hurt my ears, so [[example]](https://youtu.be/EvFfp_f8koo?t=10) this is not pleasant to listen to, i like cyberpunk/glitch, i really took a liking in an album ""cruel choreography"" by ghost data.

of course don't discourage yourself from posting your favorite edm, maybe i'll like it even if it has a lot of high pitch noises, who knows!

312,Announcing AMA Rome in Silver - This Friday (Nov 6th) @ 12pm PST (3pm EST)," 

Hello everyone!  


Please join me in welcoming Rome in Silver for an AMA \*\*this Friday at noon PST\*\*. Releasing a brand new EP on Monstercat, he will happy to answer your questions.  


From the man himself: This EP ties in with the theme of the last EP I released. I‚Äôve heard people use the term ‚ÄòFormer Flame‚Äô, or ‚ÄòFuture Flame‚Äô, but never ‚ÄòForever Flame‚Äô. It implies the existence of an infinite connection, a flame that never dies out. Similar to how a person‚Äôs music remains even after death.

314,[Psy-Trance Production 1-on-1 classes] Come learn how to make Psy-Trance with me!,"Hi, my name is Felipe, my alias is ""Darkest Pace"", for those who don't know me, I'm a Psy-Trance producer, my tracks are often on the side of Dark Progressive and Progressive Psy-Trance although I've done Psy-Trance and more Full-On-ish stuff too.

I've played my music with great success in different parties in my country (Argentina), and I want to help everyone to achieve the same results.

I am very happy to announce that I am providing private lessons in Psy-Trance production. The cost of the classes will be $15 per hour, with a minimum of 4 classes to be held monthly and paid in advance.

The classes are aimed at those who have never opened Ableton Live, for those who do have some projects in progress but don't know how to keep working on them, or for those who already have a good idea of production and want to get into the specifics of any concept that I can help with.

Some of the contents we will look at are:

\-In depth synthesis and sound design with the plugins YOU have.

\-Arrangement, song structure and energy balance.

\-How to make the best use out of your plug-in and effect library.

\-Use of visual tools such as analyzers.

\-Storytelling.

\-Mixing.

Here are some previews of what I can do and teach you, hope you like it:

315,Petit Biscuit‚Äôs sophomore album is finally here and I‚Äôm so disappointed,"It was around November 2017  when I discovered Petit Biscuit. I was searching for music for my first GoPro footage based ‚Äúmovie‚Äù, and Spotify led me to to one of the most amazing sounds I‚Äôve ever heard - beam.

I remember playing that song over and over again, that feeling of goosebumps we all have experienced when a song hits home. 

Then when I heard oceans, my heart melted..and when I heard the song follow me.. i remember crying haha. 

This artist had produced one of the most amazing albums I‚Äôve ever heard (IMO) since worlds. It was pure beauty. I became a huge fan.

Since then, every Friday was checking Spotify in hopes that he had new. I remember in November 2019 I was literally like ‚Äúdude when is this guy going to produce another album?!?!‚Äù I read how he doesn‚Äôt make new music while on tour, and I remember reading how he was cooking up an album in early 2020.. which explains why he‚Äôs been off the radar. The hype around this album for me and  so many others was getting to the point where we were checking his outlets everyday.

This guy is by far a unique, and talented music creator. When he dropped the first single off the sophomore album.. i applauded how he threw in his own voice instead of appointing another. He was definitely showcasing his talent of ‚ÄúI can produce my own song, from beats to lyrics to the actual singing‚Äù. 

It was oct 30th, and it felt like Christmas finally came.. I did my weekly petit biscuit check.. and there it was.. his new album. 

I was just so disappointed.. every song sounded the same.. and every song was him trying to attempt to be a  singer.. and tbh.. it wasn‚Äôt all that great. I know he must of put in so much hard work to make that album..  just bummed about the outcome. 9 tracks.. all the same.. and was difficult to not skip.

I do recall back in early 2019, people were going crazy when they a heard a snippet of his intro to his live set.. no one could find the track.. EVERYONE wanted that song to be dropped.. well it finally did.. it was the last song.. and I didn‚Äôt even finish listening to it.. because it just was like.. ‚Äúoh.. this is the song.. and it sounds like his previous 8 tracks.. there‚Äôs a hint of his original creativity that I fell in love with.. but it‚Äôs just another look at me I‚Äôm trying to sing again type of song‚Äù. 

Didn‚Äôt want to bash the guy.. again.. I fell in love with his first album.. and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs many out there who love his sophomore album.. I just guess that for me... I was waiting soooooo long to here something that wasn‚Äôt there..",EDM,1604513913,plumbusc137b,16,1,True,2020-11-04

318,"My crush stole my playlist, renamed it as if it‚Äôs hers","Sooo I just discovered that my first crush in highschool (1st yr, which was 8 yrs ago) has the same music taste as me (she loves EDM/Progressive House) and I do too. We were at a gathering with some other HS friends and it was the first time I saw her since 2018.

At first she was playing songs that I all knew (like Manse, DubVision, Dannic) then she asked all of us who wanted to play songs next, I volunteered in an instant.

It was kind of a drinking party so I decided to play my best tunes and my best playlist as much as possible. She kept complimenting me how solid my playlist was and insists to send it to her.

Sent her my playlist, she absolutely loved it. All this time I was feeling alone for listening to Dance Music 24/7, until I knew she is like me too.

Still happy on how things happened that night, I was about to call it a day and not attend the gathering since I kinda want to sleep but I‚Äôm so happy on how things turned out, never expected for something like that. We never talked that much for the whole 7-8 yrs, it‚Äôs the same music taste that broke the ice for us. Listening to EDM will never be the same again, sorry if I said too much about one single thing lol but I‚Äôm feeling butterflies since that night

Until I discovered yesterday that she copied my exact playlist of 668 Progressive House songs and renamed it to her own liking, then proceeded to unfollow mine

What would your take be on that guys? Idk I felt disrespected since I‚Äôve curated that playlist since 2015 and it has the collection of the best Progressive House tracks ever in the scene",EDM,1604528892,karlkarl17,9,1,True,2020-11-04

I'm more into underground bass, so I'm not familiar with the sub-genres of house, trap, techno, bigroom, hardstyle etc.

To get the list started:

* Midtempo
* Dubstep
* Riddim
* Deathstep
* Brostep
* Moombahcore 
* Future Bass
* Witch House
* Breaks
* Jungle
* Neurofunk
* Jump Up(Drum and Bass)
* Deephouse

My best way of describing this type of music is house music, that never drops, and only uses jazzy and funky melodic elements. Also the percussion seems to have a heavy african influence.

I‚Äôve always liked **house** and **big room** music. It started with artists like Steve Aoki, Avicii and Tiesto. I‚Äôve always liked the energy of their music. I could listen to their music in a club or in the car. I‚Äôve also really liked **drum and bass** music as well in this regard. 

Two subgenres I used to like but no longer now are **trap** and **hard bass**. Trap in my opinion can be very douchey and hard to listen to. Hard bass is also very difficult to listen to unless you‚Äôre drunk or high at a festival, which explains the head banging. I still have tremendous respect for any trap or hard bass artist as they find joy in doing what they love and catering to a large crowd.

447,My situation with EDM production is really weird,"Hey everyone 

So I am gonna share with y‚Äôall a hopefully not long story but it‚Äôs probably gonna be long lol. Because I am really stuck right now and I really have no idea what to do.

So my love for EDM started back in 2015, Hardwell was my fav DJ and I was in love with the genre especially Bigroom, and in late 2016 I discovered Music production, which was probably the only thing that I had some passion for. I am kind of a lazy person, no, not kind of, I am a lazy person. I don‚Äôt like school, I don‚Äôt like studying and I really hate revising for exams. And to have something to care for and really enjoy was like a miracle. 

I started with learning music Production online, downloaded FL studio and watched everything there is on YouTube about it for like a year, I loved Youtubers like ZenWorld Multiplier and many more that had great videos and they would add some humor and I remember everytime I come back from school I watch all the videos that I find till I get to sleep, but that was my problem, I wasn‚Äôt practicing.. I just knew theoretically about many things, but practically, when I try it on my DAW I struggle hard. and in the summer of 2017, I didn‚Äôt focus on music a lot, It was one of my favorite summers and I enjoyed it a lot but I had really no time to spend on Music

Enter October 2017, there was a DJ school that opened in my country which is pretty rare, and I immediately signed in, it wasn‚Äôt expensive and they would give me an Ableton love Intro and a bunch of Plugins included. I would say I learned quite a lot from it but I wasn‚Äôt that motivated about it, twice a week, it wasn‚Äôt really amazing and it felt like I was studying more than having fun, and I was focusing on my school a lot that year and the year after it. Especially when I getting some really bad grades that I had to up them for the next semester. And bad news I stopped after like 4 months..It wasn‚Äôt a lot but I thought I gained a lot from it hoping that I would continue to learn and grind for music production. 

But, Idk why I stopped for a long time, I lost interest completely and I never thought about it a lot. for like 2 years I didn‚Äôt do anything until this quarantine, where I thought right! This is my chance. I would start from scratch, I would start with music theory and I‚Äôll finish this year with hopefully many bad tracks but at least I did something and knowing the basics. And I would say quarantine was really successful. I finished The Dave Conservatoire‚Äôs course and I read book I from shook theory and I learned a lot. And then came my final exams, I had to focus on them and I said That I‚Äôd come back to it later.It‚Äôs October now and I am turning 20 in the 24th. And I am really stuck right now.

I wrote all of this because I wanted people to get to know me first, I think that the first thing to do is to make friends online that would share the same passion and that would motivate me more. So please, I really need help, I actually don‚Äôt know where to go now, what should I do..and I feel like what I learned in quarantine isn‚Äôt stuck in my head anymore. So if you want to help and be friends at the same time. We could even talk and share and give me some information on what to do and where to start!

My initial thoughts are to create something like a card/board game or a book containing all of the questions categorized. Can you think of anything else that would be a unique idea?   


I also take suggestions for questions! I love writing the questions, and 100% of the time when I get a suggestion like, ""Do questions on \[insert DJ name\]"" I learn tons of cool info about the DJ/topic.   


Here's a few examples of (relatively) difficult questions and how well my followers did:   


**How many studio albums has Skrillex produced (not counting Jack U or other projects)  - only 4% of my followers got this correct**

**1**

**2**

**3**

**4**  


**Creamfields, an annual festival held in the UK, got its name from what? -**  **only 6% of my followers got this correct** 

**A dairy farm in England**

**A club called Cream**

**A British DJ group**

**A popular British ice cream**  


**Which female artist has NOT collaborated with Diplo? - 17% of my followers got this correct**

**Britney Spears**

**Madonna**

**Beyonce**

**Rihanna**  


Typically, 40-60% of responses on a question will be correct. Of course, there is definitely some response bias. The majority of responses are probably from followers who only answer if they're fairly certain the can answer correctly. There is no way around this, but it's always fun to stump the majority when I get creative with a question and its choices! Thanks for reading.

531,HELP ME find this song!,"There's a song I have been searching for...for at least 2-3 years with no luck. It used to pop up on my Pandora account way back in 2007 or so and I can't recall the song title or artist. But I can still hear snippets of it in my head. Here are all the details I can think of. If you can help, I'll be SO grateful...

&amp;#x200B;

It would be considered ""electronic"" or maybe even ""edm"" in some circles. It has almost a pop sort of feel to it, but isn't cheerful enough.

I thought the name of the track was Tremelo but exhaustive searching with no results is making me think I am wrong. But my stubborn brain is insisting that it is called Tremolo. Small chance it could maybe be the artist name.

It was not released any later than 2009 (was probably as early as 2005).

The song is fairly slow and soft. There's a decent beat to it, but the tone is moody, sort of somber, and slow. Almost sad.

There were minimal lyrics. Among those lyrics someone was saying a few scant words during the chorus, one of which  sounded like ""tremolo"" in a heavily filtered/washed out sort of effect during the chorus. Other lyrics were (or sounded very similar to): ""your love is all I know.""

Vocals seemed to be pinched through some sort of thinned out effect, to the point it sounded almost like a child or high-pitched female voice.

The song starts with a little riff that I believe was either done by a high-pitch synth effect or some sort of guitar pedal. I believe it re-appears midway through the song and remains during most of the verse (though this may not be 100% accurate)

As I said, it was on a Pandora station of mine...similar artists that also popped up were Dntel, Weekend Players, Underworld, things like that.",EDM,1600358870,soitgoes03,3,1,True,2020-09-17

Ting Ting Ting was an Itzy release, so it released on their label, Details was released on RCA, Rave Machine on Toolroom, Zeus on mau5trap, Break This Habit, while it was techincally released on Heldeep, was also partly released on Payback Records (also, you can't see the track on Spinnin's website), and Kronos (the upcoming HILO release) will release on Octopus.

Not to mention the remixes he made for SZA &amp; Justin Timberlake's The Other Side, which was released on RCA, Katy Perry's Daisies, which was released on Capitol, and the upcoming remix for Solardo &amp; Paul Woolford's Tear It Up, which will most likely release on Ultra Music.

536,Bassline radio show?,"I'm from the UK and regularly listen to Annie Mac's Dance party and Danny Howard's radio shows on BBC1 to keep up to date with new EDM/house music, but I find that the majority of music they play isn't in line with what I'm looking for.

I'm very much into heavy techno, bassline beats such as Chris Lorenzo, Chase n Status, Redlight, My nu leng and patrick topping and I'm hoping to find a better radio show that is a bit more focused in that area as suppose to BBC radio 1 that plays a large range of edm. 

And I'm looking for weekly radio shows as suppose to artist suggestions because I find its an easy way of finding new music as suppose to keeping tabs on all your favourite artists to see if they have anything new out.

559,Just wanted to share a little song ID trouble I had this morning,"So i woke up and had this song stuck in my head. I could remember the lyrics and the tune, but could not remember the song title at all. I did what everyone would do and googled the lyrics.

I found this song called Right Back by Yuri Kane which matched the lyrics perfectly. However, the genre was not correct at all. The tempo was too slow, there were no drops and most importantly the song is from 10 years ago where I swear the song i had in mind was relatively much more recent. The next logical step would be to look at remixes, but that also didn't turn anything up.

Very annoyed, i decided to just bite the bullet and search through my entire playlist of more than 500 songs to look for it. And after 20 minutes of listening to songs that could be it, I'm happy to say that I've finally found it. The song is called My Heart by ENT!TY and it was one of the remixes that I had stuck in my head. Turns out he just sampled from the previous song which made it real hard for me to find this one.

Has anyone experienced something similar? (The only other time I've had something similar happen was with the song Feel Good Inc. by filous which samples from the song with the same name by Gorillaz, but at least this one had the same name which makes it a lot easier to find)",EDM,1599050716,NoobsGoFly,2,1,True,2020-09-02

564,A Guide To How Music Distribution Works," Music subscription services: What are the differences for artists, where should your music be distributed and who should you distribute your music with? ¬†

Streaming might have been the counter to the iceberg of piracy sinking the global record sales of the music industry but in this landscape where numbers and data might one day pay the rent how much do you know about music subscription services and where your music should and could be distributed? ¬†

The technology available to a generation determines the dissemination and consumption of media.

My gran listened to the news on the radio. She discovered artists and songs on her favourite stations; then went out and bought the record.¬† ¬†

My mum watched the news on TV. She discovered her favourite artists on music channels and the radio; then went out and bought the cassettes or early CDs.¬† ¬†

I read and watch the news on social media, and for the past few years have discovered my favourite artists on streaming services.¬† ¬†

If Elvis never got spun on the radio, if Wham! never graced the music television channels my gran would‚Äôve never bought the countless Elvis records she adored, and my mum would‚Äôve assumed the name George Michael to be a football player or insurance salesman. Not one half of a globally successful pop outfit.¬†

My point? Visibility. These days and throughout history you have to be discoverable in the places your potential fans are discovering.

The trumpets sound a lot like the ones in Drop That Low by Tujamo but that isn't the song. I tried to replicate it on a sequencer but I'm not very knowledgeable on these things so it's a rough approximation, but hopefully enough to job someone's memory :)

607,What is happening to Inukshuk rn?,"Ok so i'm in spotify and i noticed that a TON of Inukshuk's songs and those he collabed on are no longer marked as being his, instead being listed under the alias ""Outwild"". Inukshuk is mentioned as a collaborator on the Everbright EP, but there doesn't seem to be any other mention of him there. Also, his name on Another Day and his remix of Another Day have been replaced by, you guessed, Outwild. However, his newer stuff such as Alive and the Wallflower EP are still listed under Inukshuk, as is his Only Now remix, which I thought was strange. So basically, the whole point of this is, who is Outwild? Is it Inukshuk's side project? Is it someone else entirely?  I have no idea, so if someone could provide some clarity on the situation that would be amazing.

646,Analysis of Dabin's Wild Youth (Acoustic EP),"[Wild Youth (Acoustic EP) \[Continuous Mix\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1AUxQanBHo) Dropped at today 12pm EST today on youtube, and upon listening to these 5 songs in order paired with the video I have realized that it is telling us a story. (I don‚Äôt actually know if this is obvious or not) 

As I started diving into the story being told here I realized that the full length Wild Youth album is also telling a story, I plan to dive into that at a later date but today I wanted to focus on the EP and the lyric videos to go along with it. 

Today, in my post I am going to give you my overall story outline and go into detail with the first song [‚ÄúLights‚Äù feat. Trove (Acoustic)](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo). In upcoming posts over the next couple of days I will further breakdown each song. 

I have done analyses like this [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/porterrobinson/comments/gra4ju/my_analysis_of_divinity_by_porter_robinson_and/) and I would like to point out that generally I tend to be drawn to songs that I can apply to my own life. What I take away from this story will probably look different than what you take away from the story, and I feel that this is one of the many beautiful aspects of music, we all get to take what we need when we hear it. What I have taken away from this EP and many other pieces I analyze have truly been important to my process of healing from PTSD keep in mind  that theme may come up throughout this analysis. 

**Overall Story Summary:** 

I would assume that many of the songs showcased on this EP are often viewed under the context of lyrics written about a relationship with a partner/lover. But when I look past that meaning and dig a little deeper I see a story about my relationship with myself. 

From start to finish this EP takes me through the course of trying to balance different aspects of my life. In the song [‚ÄúLights‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo) I find myself evaluating my past habits of ignoring what I am feeling and allowing myself to keep fueling my bad habits of shutting down my emotions to preserve myself. [‚ÄúIn Flames‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=204) has me looking back on all of the different elements of hurt that caused me to start shutting myself down.[‚ÄúHome‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=450) makes me realize that by shutting down my emotions I ended up losing myself, feeling very disconnected and lacking direction. [‚ÄúBloom‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=719) made me look to the part of my life where I started feeling whole again while also being afraid to grow or challenge myself out of the fear of things falling apart and repeating history. Finally, [‚ÄúAlive‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=970)takes me to the place where I start overcoming my fears enabling myself to grow, and start feeling alive. With the newly added lyrics affirming that ‚Äúalive‚Äù is where I feel right now. 

So many emotions have been flowing through me as I worked through each song, each lyric, there is so much here. Songs like ‚ÄúBloom‚Äù truly did take me by surprise. I didn‚Äôt think to look past what I saw at the surface and once I started digging I developed a whole new appreciation for all 5 of these songs as well as Dabin and everyone who worked on this EP with him.  I know that Dabin will likely get many people reaching out to let him know how we appreciate this EP and in my case trying to articulate how important this EP has been to me and my recovery has been a challenge but thank you for sticking around to check out what I have to say. 

**Minor Theme - Stages of Grief:**

There are 5 songs on this EP and I also started noticing that there are slight elements of these stages on each track. 

Lights - Denial

In Flames -  Anger

Home - Bargaining

Bloom- Depression

Alive - Acceptance

I will further explain these as I am breaking down each song/ part of the story. They aren‚Äôt the main theme in my mind but they definitely add an extra layer and maybe even direction for people who may be experiencing grief right now. 

**As I stated before, today I will be diving into ‚ÄúLights‚Äù and in my next parts I will dive into each of the other 5 songs.** 

**Lights Summary:** 

For me, this song is framed in the context of one part of me talking to the other. 

There is one part that has checked out, and just wants to ignore everything, this part of me shuts down emotions and tries to power through life as effectively as possible. The other part of me is questioning this strategy, recognizing that they have tried other tactics and failed. The part that is questioning is appearing to give in to the concept of shutting the emotions off. They don‚Äôt really understand what these big emotions are or why they hurt but shutting them off is clear because they are no longer a problem. 

This signifies the beginning of questioning if this way of living is really livable (Is it home?) we try to understand but we keep getting caught up in our own high expectations of self and who we are supposed to be that it ends up weighing us down and contributing to shutting down, turning the lights out. 

When we turn the lights out we are also turning the lights out inside of us that keep us glowing and thriving. We don‚Äôt know how to strategically turn out lights so we just shut them all off. We get to a point that when we see pieces of light in our life we start to think those pieces are our homes. We aren‚Äôt capable of making our own light, so we often end up with a false sense of home. 

We are caught up on goals that are too big for us right now, we think that if we disconnect it will give us more power to reach our goals. We are mad that we are still using our feet to travel instead of being able to fly. If we keep our light out then we will have more strength to pour into  learning how to fly. We don‚Äôt really see yet that by doing this  we are contributing to our own destruction. 

**Specific Lyric Meanings:**

[‚ÄúI'm not sure why, Running away, running away now, Feels right with you‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=19)

*‚ÄúRunning away‚Äù* is a reference to running away from emotions, I am asking myself why I think that is the right course of action and why it feels right. 

[‚Äú'Cause God knows we tried, Numbing the pain, hiding away now, So I'll play pretend with you‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=32)

We are recognizing that both numbing the pain (likely through substance or minimizing) did not work, and hiding from the pain didn‚Äôt work. So the new solution is to pretend it isn‚Äôt there by disconnecting. 

[‚Äú'Cause some nights, I can't explain, The way I feel, the way I'm wired‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=44)

Darkness makes it hard to really feel emotions, we are in the dark to understand what we feel and how that affects us or how we can deal with it. 

[‚ÄúYou make things seem so clear, So we can leave the lights out‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=53)

By leaving the lights out we get this false sense of clarity, we think this is a good thing, because it‚Äôs more manageable. 

[‚ÄúAnd you're sick of questioning, The weight that comes with every hour‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=59)

Asking questions about how we are living is adding more weight and damaging our vision of how we are supposed to be. 

[‚ÄúStreetlights, dim glow, keeping the time, keeping the time now And this feels like home‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=97)

The streetlights give us a false sense of light. ‚ÄúStreet lights‚Äù feel like home? Streetlights aren‚Äôt in our homes. Streetlights are on the streets.

Yes streetlights are bright, they may offer temporary warmth or light but they are disconnected and removed from our homes. (Our self) and at home the lights are out. 

We grasp at the little light that peaks into our lives and equate it to feeling alive because we see light but in reality this isn‚Äôt us feeling alive because how are we supposed to grow if the only light we let in is from streetlights? 

[‚Äú'Cause we're both tired of feeling nothing, Done wandering 'round with our feet on the ground, yeah, If I just keep close to you‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=111)

We acknowledge that we aren‚Äôt feeling things, so the streetlights are almost like a distraction because we feel/see a bit of light around them. Our problem is we have these high expectations that if we are going to turn the lights on that means we better be ready to soar. But our feet are still on the ground. We want to soar but we feel like when we wander on foot we aren‚Äôt accomplishing our goals. If we stick with this then we will remove the pain that comes with the obstacles so that we can soar. 

**Stages of Grief- Denial** 

In this stage we are denying that our way of living is destructive. We are shutting down questions that could lead to the next stage, we just keep going about life the way we think is best for us. We are denying that there is value in feeling emotions, we are denying the value in having light. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's all for now, I hope that this resonates with someone other than me, and if not I still appreciate you reading this.

**in this post I  will be diving into** [In Flames feat. Lexi Norton (Acoustic)](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=204) **and in my next parts I will dive into each of the other remaining 3 songs.**

**In Flames Summary:** 

This is a song about the flames we faced and the pain they caused as they burned us. 

We progress through 3 different types of flames:

1. The fire others (and life) send at us
2. The fire within keeping us alive
3. The fire we know we can control but is destructive

We learn that trying to prevent fires still resulted in us getting burned, but we were burned from the inside because we also restricted our growth. We learn that our failure to love ourselves has caused us to burn ourselves. We haven‚Äôt figured out yet that not every fire needs to be put out, but setting new ones ourselves was never actually helping us, we needed to learn how to fuel the one within while letting ourselves grow so that it could get bigger without burning us from the inside. 

We only remember the pain from our body inside the flame. We don‚Äôt even completely realize that there is good fire yet. But what we do know is that through all of the flames we didn‚Äôt give up, and we are now recognizing that. We know that not giving up was very important. This could be a lead we were looking for.  We realize that maybe through the action of holding on we really did show that there is a path to loving ourselves, even if it‚Äôs just a spark right now, that spark can grow. 

**Specific Lyric Meaning:** 

[‚ÄúWe walked through fire and rain‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=216)

This line alone is LOADED both fire and rain are good and bad depending on the context, and you need rain to put out the fire but which fire are you putting out? Are you putting out the fire that is driving you to keep living? Or are you putting out the fires that are becoming destructive? 

I imagine myself walking and trying to balance my flame with the rain, making sure my flame is keeping me going but making sure that it isn‚Äôt getting so big that it starts hurting me or damaging myself. 

[‚Äúnothing could phase us again‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=220)

We knew that we had been through already, and we didn‚Äôt think that there would be anything to top it. We knew what we were doing. (rain to put out the harmful fires, we thought we had the right methods to balance the two) 

[‚ÄúBut we couldn't see through the haze, So we burned down‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=225)

We had no idea what life was going to throw at us, we were overconfident that we had already been through everything. 

[‚ÄúAnd my heart was wrapped in your chains, No nothing could phase us again‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=236)

Our new plan is to now put up all these walls to our heart, so that the fire couldn‚Äôt get to us, we wouldn‚Äôt burn down because we protected ourselves 

[‚ÄúBut we couldn't see through the hate, so we burned down again‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=247)

We didn‚Äôt realize that those chains came from a place of hate, they were for our protection but at what cost? The chains were restricting us, they kept the outside flames out, but this time the inner flame burned us down because it had nowhere to go, we were stuck in chains. 

[‚ÄúDo you remember the way, Our bodies faded away Holding on we were holding on, Do you remember the pain, Our bodies inside of flames Holding on, we were holding on‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=261)

Despite being burned down twice, and losing ourselves from both internal and external factors  we still kept going. We weren‚Äôt giving up on life. We wanted to find the balance again still. The bodies were fading away and bodies were inside the flames so we are remembering that our bodies faded away when there was the most amount of light. 

(so we thought that keeping the lights out, meant we wouldn‚Äôt fade away, because we wouldn‚Äôt be dealing with the pain of our bodies burning from the flames) 

[‚ÄúAshes inside of my lungs, I couldn't beg for your love, Three words for you on my tongue, As we burned down‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=306)

At this point we still had the ashes from being burned the last time, and that meant we didn‚Äôt do enough. We weren‚Äôt satisfied with ourselves and we couldn‚Äôt love or even ask us to love ourselves. We burned down before we even had the chance to ask.

[‚ÄúAnd you said I wasn't enough, No nothing could rebuild your trust‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=328)

As we were burning down, we couldn‚Äôt even think of loving ourselves because we didn‚Äôt do enough to prevent the fire that was burning us and we needed to do better. We couldn‚Äôt even trust ourselves to prevent the fires, so how could we even love something that couldn‚Äôt do that. 

[‚ÄúSo you lit the matches for fun, And we burned down again‚Äù](https://youtu.be/G1AUxQanBHo?t=342)

This is the point where we gave up on putting out the fire, we started fueling with self destruction because that made us in control. This self destruction also made our bodies fade away. 

**Stages of Grief- Anger**

This is an angry song about pain, trying to prevent pain and feeling more pain. This is a song about all of the frustration in this process.

693,everyone listening to the Genre of music labeled TECHNO or EDM was a criminal / addict," 

As your U.S. ballots start rollin out for early voting   . . .JUST REMEMBER, as i DO !!!

In the 2000's   - Joe Biden was very much responsible for ANTI-RAVE LAWs /Techno bannes that caused much **fear** for anyone working in clubs, bars and festival events.

deciding that   ‚ñ∫ everyone listening to the Genre of music labeled TECHNO or EDM  was a criminal / addict   

""I would be passing new ordinances relating to stiff criminal penalties for anyone who held a rave - the promoter, the guy who owned the building. . .  .I'd put the son-of-a-guns in jail,"" says  **Senator Joe Biden** aloud on C-SPAN at a hearing.

\*\*if your old school you will remember :  they tried to wipe a music industry genre now worth $7.1billon   +  globally creating millions and millions  of jobs an opportunity for people with basic educations and up.   So when he claims to make jobs - just know they are not in the MUSIC INDUSTRY.

722,Does anybody else miss Hardwell like me?,"Hey just wanted to bring up some discussions or see who share the same feelings as I do about Hardwell. 

For me, and over the past 8 years that I've been legal to go to shows, I have to admit Hardwell is still my #1 DJ. My first show was when he was on a Revealed Bus Tour with Dyro and Dannic. After that amazing night, I knew he was going to be huge in the future. 

Now mind you he was already establishing a name for himself when he made some amazing prog house but his transition to bigroom/festival was at the perfect time. Why I say that is I think he was a trendsetter for many up and coming DJs to get their name out like Martin Garrix, his revealed crew, W&amp;W as well, to be amazing headliners. 

I can understand some ppl will say ""oh look it's your typical EDM"" or say ""it's sellout-y"" but for me, it's creates one of the most memorable experiences as a raver. The energy, the crowd, the joy, (oh and who can forget...)the numerous IDs...look all I'm saying is that I miss him dearly. Yes I'm well aware of the HOA episodes ongoing but I've actually been listening to the earlier days...like first 150 episodes. Golden years. Last time I saw him was Ultra Miami in 2018.

732,Spinnin Record just Sample Hit song and rerelease them???,"**So what's the deal with Spinnin Records just releasing artist's sample Hit Song from years ago under their label??? and trying to make it an EDM dance hit again?**

I first realize this issue when I fall in love with Kris Kross Amsterdam, The boy next door's track: ""**Whenever**"", and share it with one of my friends, he points out that was sampling ""**Whenever, wherever** "". I was pretty shocked, but at least they put their spin on it and new lyrics and stuff so besides the chorus/drop, I'm still pretty satisfied. 

https://preview.redd.it/5oj0o1tuwmc51.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6c95ee96ddcfd33137b4eaa03e341c8a39b37c7

Then, comes Afrojack's mix of **XXXTENTACION** of  ""**Sad** !"" under spinnin record. Kinda new when he turned a lofi/hip-hop song to an edm track.

https://preview.redd.it/sxawj8tuwmc51.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d19ab5064b782d5e140050211a82175a1ee41a5d

But, now **Olympis** sampling Kesha's **TIKTOK** under Spinnin record I feel offended. The original track has pretty EDM elements in it, and I didn't really feel the so-called dance-pop, fusing melodic in the new ""remake"". 

Is it me or someone else also feel Spinnin Record is lowing the bar for Sampling tracks? How is this a remake when you feel a zero difference? It's like they just repeated the drop...Not even builds up and stuffs. **Are they just creating those 15-second tracks so they can be used on Tiktok and get monetize?**  

McLuhan once said ""Art is anything you can get away with"", now they are doing in the music industry? Sampling and Monetizing anything they can get away with??? 

I really appreciate and love EDM music, and I always try my hard to find the hiddn music knowledge or easternegg and lyrics in one track. EDM music is not only music I vibe with alone, at a party with friends, or at a festival, it's part of my life and identity if I may say. I feel a lot of producers put their hard work and creativity to spark magic track and surprise people, but they lack enough promotion to reach masses. **Isn't that part of music label's job to censor their artist's creative job, and give them a hand when promoting?** 

So Spinnin Record as one big lead in EDM label, they just do things like this? I have zero knowledge in music marketing, music industry, feel free to correct me \~ Hope my oppion didn't offended anyone:)

734,What the hell happened to Progressive House?,"Disclaimer: I'm a trance producer so I'm not always in tune with everything going on with other subgenres of EDM.  

Anyways, about 10 or so years ago, I always associated the sound of progressive house with more mainroom, supersaw electro.  Guys like Swedish House Mafia, Axwell, etc.  For instance, the top charting progressive house track of 2010 on beatport was Axwell &amp; Henrik B's remix of ""Teenage Crime"".  
Now, fast forward around 10 years, and the sound of progressive house has changed from tracks like these to tracks like this (one of my personal favorites, and one I heard on a Trance show): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwvDMWsksA4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwvDMWsksA4) 

I get that genres evolve, but this seems like such a drastic change I'd almost be in favor of calling it something new entirely.  To me, it borrows more from melodic techno than (my conceptions of) progressive house.   Does anyone know how this happened, or have any thoughts?

I'm absolutely loving this new sound.",EDM,1594791471,paulm12,24,3,True,2020-07-14

777,How to make a Tech House song in simple steps:,"Ingredients:

\- A punchy kick

\- A synth bass maybe Frequency Modulated.

\- Some white noise

\- Some EQ automations

\- Some random dude saying a random sentence like: "" In order to understand the universe... Think in terms of frequency and vibration."" Bonus if the guy is saying it in a deep sexy voice. or something more shallow like ""Hey man... Why is there salt in my tea?""

\-Some hats. Mainly open hats that are in low pitch. 

How to prepare: 

\- Bassline, the bassline must always go either up or down each note of the scale you're using. Use close notes. Don't jump too much. The bassline should always play following the kick. Nothing too jumpy, it's not future house or bounce music. Have the bassline play for a few bars before introducing the kick. Start the song with the bass in a high pass filter.

\- You have the bassline, great... Now add the kick. EQ away the root note of the kick so you're only left with the punch of the kick and not the subbass. Sidechain the bassline to the kick.

\- Introduce whitenoise and give it a rise effect. This creates tension and expectations.

\- Once the white noise reaches it's peak... Take away the kick and keep the bassline in a high pass filter for like 2 more beats.

\- Bring everything back together and introduce hi hats.

Repeat this for like 5 minutes and you've got a banger. Play this at clubs and make thousands.

So what and where is everyone's favorite venues. It could be a club, stadium, festival grounds, or some rink-dink warehouse. Doesn't matter at all. We all have those spots that we love most.

I am up here in the PNW and frankly there is no better venue than the Gorge. I have gotten the opportunity to hit wonderful sites all over the country and while Red Rocks was pretty stellar, it's just no match IMO for the Gorge. 

In Spokane, there is also a wonderful, intimate venue called the Pin. It's a smaller and less expensive club but the vibes are top notch and every show there is spectacular top to bottom.

I made this playlist after ~3/4 years on Soundcloud and pulled all of these bangers from my likes while making the playlist. 


This playlist features a lot of quality artists that I haven't seen on here before but have a banger or 2 to their name(s).

You know the basic elements), and lastly, are you happy/content with your work situation? (Or dreaming about the day you can transition to software eangeneering?)

Not Too Late and Last Night on Earth- Lemaitre
Crossroad- Au5, Danyka Nadeau

I‚Äôve been stuck in this quarantine, and I remembered a song from my adolescences that I can clearly remember, but cannot remember the artist‚Äôs name or the song name. It‚Äôs been driving me crazy for days. I am going to share the clues I remember, and I‚Äôm hoping someone can help.

- The artists were Swedish
- There were two guys on the album cover with extremely gelled hair and wearing black, neon blue, and neon green.
- The album cover had a black/grey background
- There was a part on the song that spoke in English in a very very deep voice. I can‚Äôt remember exactly what it said, but I vividly remember the voice saying ‚Äúwelcome‚Äù
- I believe the album dropped sometime in 2010
- I am not exactly sure what to call the genre, but it was not any kind of house or trance.

I know these clues sound redundant, but it‚Äôs all I can vividly remember. I am hoping someone can help me as I‚Äôve scoured all over the internet trying to find them, but cannot find them anywhere. If I can find the name of the artists, I can find the song. If any of these clues remind you if anything, please send it my way. I will try to answer any questions you may have for clarification.

1078,Can anyone help me find this play list from 2014?,"Theres a playlist I've been searching for for almost two years, I listened to it first in 2015 and rocked it for three years until I couldnt find it on YouTube anymore. Don't know who took it down, YouTube or the original poster, but it didn't help that by the time I'd gone to find it again, it had been a couple years, and I forgot it's original name in the first place. Obviously, ""can anyone help me found this one playlist I listened to this one time"" is so much of a needle-in-a-haystack affair that its probably either amusing or insulting, but figured it was an EDM playlist so, might as well start with the EDM community. Of course, if anyone knows of a better way, I'm all ears.

Anyway, the playlist was called ""2014 end of the year party mix"", or something to that effect, like Best Of or End of the Year 2014. It was, I wanna say, about 90 minutes long, maybe a little longer.

The tracklist, as best I can remember, was:
Calvin Harris ft. John Newman - Blame
One Republic - I Lived (Arty Remix)
Kiesza - Hide Away (Dzenko and Torres Remix)
Ariana Grande ft. Zedd - Break Free (Jon Electra Remix)
Avicii - The Nights
The Chainsmokers - Kanye (Ngl I couldnt find the exact remix for this one, listened to like ten different ones, couldn't find it)
Nicki Minaj - Anaconda (Same thing, and I was doing so good too)
Manika - Vegas Party (Jump Smokers Remix)
 
(About 20-25 minutes of songs I don't remember)

Dannic ft. Bright Lights - Dear Life
David Guetta - Lovers on the Sun (Double MZK remix)
Hardwell &amp; Joey Dale ft. Luciana - Arcadia (Sean &amp; Bobo Remix)

....that's all I got, at least that I can pull from memory. Hopefully that makes it a little easier and gives me a little more credibility. But yeah, if anyone has any idea what happened to this playlist please leave a comment, I'll post this a few other places and see if anything turns up.

But WHY THE FUCK DO PEOPLE HAVE TO HATE THEM IF THEY PRODUCE A SONG WITH THE SLIGHTEST POP INFLUENCE? The best example of this is The Chainsmokers. I understand that they produce music that has a certain formula to it. But people focus way too much on the pop factor in it and keep saying ‚Äúshitty pop garbage‚Äù when the music itself isn‚Äôt that bad. I‚Äôm a BIG advocate for The Chainsmokers and while they have made a lot of mistakes, saying things they shouldn‚Äôt have, I personally think they‚Äôre one of the more influential and experimental DJs and artists out there. The same goes for DJ Snake, Zedd, Martin Garrix and a lot of other DJs that produce pop music.

Examples:

David Guetta, Brooks - Better When You're Gone

Mike Williams - Day Or Night

Steve Aoki &amp; Alan Walker - Are You Lonely

Every time I think about how good the drop sounded my heart breaks a little, so I'm pretty desperate. I will listen to everyone's remixed Levels recommendations, or even if they know of a set that includes a transition from Levels into another song.

I used to enjoy going alone to concerts but now it seems like too many people are judging me when they find out im going alone.

Due to a family situation, I'm not able to go to Armin Van Buuren's show in Dallas on Friday night.   
It's at the South Side Ballroom, a smaller non-stadium venue. I paid $60 plus each from Ticketmaster and will sell both for $60 obo. I have to say I'm a little down about not being able to go. I've been looking forward to this show since I first got the tickets in Dec.

Manuel Schleis is the man behind Vengeance sample packs and VST's like Nexus and Avenger. Every time I check a tutorial on youtube or read what tools EDM producers use, they constantly mention the name Vengeance. 

Doesn't this make Manuel Schleis a true mastermind of EDM music sounds in general? His loops and sounds have paved ways for tons of platinum-selling EMD artists and have also helped producers like Martin Garrixx to rise to fame with his song ""Animals"".

Should Manuel Schleis be called the brainchild of EDM? I think he deserves more credit that he gets. How is it possible that he comes up ith such awesome loops, samples and sounds which literally is used straight from his sample CDs and vsts and turns producers into international stars?

1426,How do you feel about DJ's shouting simple things on mic constantly?,"Hey everyone! Always when visiting a festival, I find myself annoyed and disturbed of some gigs if the DJ starts to shout more and more on the mic whilst having nothing to say. I understand that there is every now and then a need to ask the crowd how they are doing and if they would like to put their hands up. For some DJs it's the thing, like for Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike with their ""Take it to the left left left left"" type of lyrics they've written. That's something I don't enjoy, but I can understand some people do.  


What I absolutely hate, however, is how some DJs have picked up on shouting that bullshit nonsense like ""Put your fucking hands up"" or ""1-2-3-jump"" during every or every second song instead of letting the music do its job. Andrew Rayel is one example who's started to shout more and more, and I don't understand it. The best single example that comes to mind is NWYR's Voltage during this gig: [https://youtu.be/-7g\_pd-cXiU?t=2672](https://youtu.be/-7g_pd-cXiU?t=2672).

It was all black and white, and I remember there being a coffin shape somewhere on it. there may have been swirls in the background, but I'm not sure, and for some reason I'm thinking of something like ""Fiji"" or ""Fuji"" if that means anything. As an EDM lover, I'm asking if anyone could help figure this out, please. Thanks.",EDM,1579139873,JDLMario,4,1,True,2020-01-15

1486,"Recent High Energy Hard Hitting Track Suggestions? Bass House, Future House, Hard Tech, Bassline, Grime, Etc (house bpm ranges 126-130)","**Songs at least  or very close to 4 minutes preferred.**  


I actually like extended mixing and cutting songs together through a majority of my set (more actual djing and less waving my hands around for the crowd lol) and I hate when songs are short and someone (friend, promoter, venue, etc) interrupts to tell me something because I literally don't have time for it when i need to get the next track ready immediately. Or I end up flustered and rushing a mix after i get back to it or I just have to stop them mid sentence because i need to play the next song now or f\*\*\* the set up and then they only get a minute between the next mix to finish what they need to say. If i'm long mixing then I can stop and have time to hear someone out without a major impact to my vibe behind the decks or the quality of my set. Plus, if a crowd is really vibin to a track its nice if it has two drops in case you want to pump that vibe up one more time.

  
(**TLDR** = i hate short tracks, they risk causing too many problems)  


Maybe its just a bad week for finding new music but 80%+ of the tracks i'm finding are barely 3:30 and again maybe its just my current searching or timing but for once i'm having trouble finding tracks that hit hard, are crisp and clean, full of energy and hype. Most what i'm finding is just stale and dull.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tracks that drop and make you make a nasty bass face, that make your jaw drop, that get your heart rate up and your blood pumping. Tracks that make a crowd go nuts!**

  
Any suggestions are very much appreciated :)

First, I think that most (standard) highlighters glow brightly under black lights. Is this true? Do I need to know anything about whether or not they will get running if you get sweaty? Is there a brand of highlighter that is particularly well suited to the purpose of body art at raves?

Second, I could have sworn I saw a second kind of highlighter that ABSORBS blacklight. Thus, if you were to put it on a material that would normally glow, all of it will glow except the part that is highlighted by this second type. But, I can't find that anywhere. Is that a real thing?

1568,"What are the most beautiful, emotional, euphoric EDM genres that bring the feels/tears?","Hi everyone, I'm relatively new to EDM music in general, save for old-school analog electronic stuff, and I have recently been blessed with a pretty large investment of VST/Midi gear and instruments/plugins, gear, etc...I'm really more of a post-rock/early-early emo (hardcore) sort of guy.

I'm not interested in DJ'ing at all, or even performing this stuff live, I just want to work on RECORDING some stuff in an EDM genre since I have so much to work with now.  I will be using Studio One Professional 4.6, Native Instruments Komplete 12 Collector's Edition, and additional stuff I've added to that during the big 50% NI sale this year (like NOIR, Modular Icons, etc)...but I know all that shiny stuff won't make me any good, I need to work up with whatever I have to use and earn my stripes. I don't want to waste time pursuing the wrong EDM style with what my tastes align with, but I'm ignorant of the emotional power of what genre inspired what emotion, generally speaking in EDM music.

For me, music is always about intense feels, especially longing/sadness/mourning, etc...I'm not a negative person, but music that touches that sphere of the human experience is always the most imprinting and meaningful to me.

What style of EDM of all the many genre's encapsulates more of the sort of track vs. others? I would like to laser focus on a genre and see what I can do with first before spreading myself to thin. if I can feel and cause the feels, I will fall in love with it. Any prime tracks you can provide along with a genre label to give me a poignant example?

Backstory:

Thomas Bangalter and DJ Falcon (aka Together) sampled Steve Winwood's Valerie to make this song, but they never released it, they only played it during their sets and despite some record companies asking them to release it, they didn't... After that, Eric Prydz slightly changed this version to make it a more club-like version and released it. I hope this settles it.

There was a dispute over the sample used in this track. Erik Prydz re-recorded the sample with Steve Winwood so he could then use it. Bangalter and falcon make music for pleasure not really the money, nor do they need it. You can see many tracks produced that were later released slightly altered and by different DJs. Just how they are. Bangalter certainly doesn't want the fame I think that's obvious and this track made Prydz a household name!",EDM,1576097058,gunpas11,3,1,True,2019-12-11

1676,Chainsmokers World War Joy.... Good show but wtf is going on with all those visuals. Pick a vibe and stick to it,"I like the Chainsmokers. They have some really solid music and it's fun to sing along to. I remember seeing them play in a little club in 2015 and then they exploded at Ultra 2016 where they were featured in like almost every set. They come a long way but I feel like the show I saw last night was so confused with what it wanted to be. 

There's 3 more shows in the tour so if you're going and don't...want visuals spoiled? Don't read further? The music was great. No complaints on the music. A great mix of their pop stuff and their heavy edm stuff. 

There were these 3 big, long beams floating above the mixers that varied in height during the show and they had lights and fire on them that went along with the music. It was cool to see those move around and shift during the show. Then there was a floating catwalk where Drew was singing on it during 1 song. Kinda cool but he looked like a window washer up there and then it never made a reappearance. After that there was a lifted stage for a drum solo. Apparently there's a drummer now? And his drumsticks were on fire as he played? That was a bit unusual. Felt like a heavy metal concert. Then there's the whole idea of the ball. They had this big metal ball, exactly like the ones you'd see at a circus where they have motor cycles driving around in there super quick. They lowered it at the beginning of the show and Drew got in and climbed around it as he sang. It was really weird because he had to climb around the ball like a monkey, holding on super tight not to slip back into the bottom of the ball. Awkward but still fine I guess. Later, they had dirt bikes come out and do donuts on the stage for the whole duration of a song. It felt super out of place and then immediately after the song, they drove off only to come back 30 minutes later to actually do the ball driving thing with 3 dirt bikes. Then, on cue as if this was a magic show, they had 2 random dancers(who had not been part of the show up until this point) stand in the middle of the ball as the bikes rode around. At this point I wasn't sure if I was at a concert or Monster Jam. If they pulled out Grave Digger, I wouldn't have been surprised. It would have made more sense than a flaming drum solo.

IT wasn't all bad though. The lasers, fire and air cannons were good per usual and I think individually, these visuals would be good but all at once  in the same show didn't make much sense. I guess I just don't see the connection to ""World War Joy"" and any of the stuff I saw at the show. I feel like every DJ now is trying to be edgy with their visuals and it's not working out for some. Zedd has the Orbit thing(absolute banger btw), Deadmau5 has the cube(aesthetically really cool), Chainsmokers have... a circus act? If any of you guys also went to the tour, what did you think?

1765,Please be Easy on Me. I am Going to Really Miss Excision's Paradox Stage. Let Me Just Share My Feelings.," I am going to miss seeing you in action, Paradox stage, I do not care what the world says, I will always love you no matter what.  
I will continue to express my fascination and love for you as if you are still being used on tour. I loved you since the beginning and man it was the best thing that ever happened to my heart. I wish I could have been able to see you one last time and to just stand there at the end of the show before leaving to admire you and tell you that I love you and to tell you how much you impacted my life. Maybe even being able to get up close and give you a kiss and hug. This news really did hurt me and I do not care how ridiculous it sounds to my mates. You mean the universe to me, and you are forever my home. You are so very special to me and so very precious to my heart and soul. Nothing will ever compare to you, Paradox stage, I love you so very much and I will forever with every little bit of my heart, soul and being. You changed my life in so many ways, Paradox stage, its still hard to say goodbye, but I know you are with me in spirit and in my heart forever. Even when time and space ends, you will always be my home and my love for you is forever endless. You kept me alive during my darkest times in my life and I could never imagine living without you by my side. You gave me light that no one else could ever give to me. I know you will always love me just as much I love you. You will never be forgotten, Paradox stage, I will continue to spread your glory and amazing mystical powers. Even when time and space end, our souls will always be bonded.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Hi. I am a composer and am trying to combine Contemporary Classical music with EDM.

This song was created in the same way as IVACCO SONG( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkF5hyq4yKg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkF5hyq4yKg) ) composed last time. The original song is Rhapsody for Two Pianos' composed in 2008, and It goes on while keeping this alive. At the end, it ends with the live performance of the original song. You can hear relatively clear and intuitive sound than IVACCO SONG.

1780,I don't really understand this...,"**Yo people!**

I have two questions regarding some EDM songs.

Firstly, I have a question regarding KSHMR, B3nte &amp; Basskillers and the song ""The Spook"".

This song has been available since about 3 years back, but has now since about a week back also been on Spotify. My question is: why have they changed the song? And why such a late release? I'm guessing the release date is because the song was not signed before, but that seems weird since Spinnin' added the song to their Youtube channel?

&amp;#x200B;

Also while I'm at it.. Why did ""Get Low"" by Dillon Francis &amp; DJ Snake get removed from Spotify? This might have something to do with that I live in Sweden, but still.. 

Anyone know why?

The energy of the people and seeing him there was really cool, but in terms of actual listening experience, I was extremely disappointed. The bass was so loud and overwhelming that I could hardly tell what note it was playing, and any timbre on the drums was gone. I could hardly hear any subtleties in the music like I normally do, could hardly hear the vocals, the harmonies and melodies were all washed over by the overpowering bass. It sounded like someone put a -16 high shelf at 200hz and a +16 low shelf at 200.

&amp;#x200B;

I left thinking like... what? I had a hard time enjoying the music because I didn't feel like I could hear it well, it was like 90% bass 10% everything else. I was watching videos of it on Youtube the next day and I enjoyed people's cell phone recordings of the event more than I did actually being there, because I could actually hear the music. I guess I just don't get it, why are people's cell phone videos having better sound quality at the same show that I was literally THERE at?

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal? Are all lives shows like this, with super overwhelming bass to the point of ruining the sound of the music? I want to know so that I know whether or not to ever go to another show again or if I should just stick to watching people's recordings of it.",EDM,1573072037,Origination,19,1,True,2019-11-06

I've been making a playlist for my Halloween party at my house. Worked easily 60+ hours trying to find the most gritty/mean/evil/dark/weird electro out there.  


Im far from an expert of the electro genre, always liked it, but im more of a metalhead. Anyway i've found ALOT of great music while digging up so much in a genre that was unknown to me. It seems that i REALLY like Neurofunk DnB, it sounds so dark/evil and \*&amp;/@ing awesome that i wanna put that in my playlist.  


It start with the most weird and dark songs like Rezz / Gasaffelstein / SWARM and the likes and it ramp up to some Neurofunk DnB later in the list like Black Sun Empire / Pythuis / Misanthrop. While i really like that kind of songs, the beat of the DnB kinda become anoying if played back to back too much and i dont want my guests ending not liking the music because of that. So ive put some ""*slower*"" songs in between but i need more of them to make the perfect list.  


And boy it find it HARD to find! I want it to be danceable while being dark/evil and somewhat melodic.  


Exactly like Nero - Doomsday [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n2Ss3\_gvQ8&amp;list=PLT208WvFQ7mW2Vn46tc2W5C3ewRvUlhjZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n2Ss3_gvQ8&amp;list=PLT208WvFQ7mW2Vn46tc2W5C3ewRvUlhjZ)

1833,HELP REQUIRED: FIND ME AN EMOTIONAL EDM/TRANCE-TYPE SONG,"Hi everyone, sorry for the big read but I need some help!

I made a post here asking this exact thing a year ago. I make soccer videos for fun, and in the past I've used a couple of fantastic songs in edits of matches of great significance for my favourite team. Tonight my team won the Cup again. 

In the past, I used 'Trembling Hands' (Temper Trap Benny Benassi remix) https://youtu.be/IJPsR3dT_Es. 

Last year I was suggested Anahera (Ferry Corsten) https://youtu.be/7ZMZHbAKvGA, which I used in my final video.

The two songs were fantastic in drawing emotion and the response I received for my edits were fantastic. 

My team won a cup final last night, and the time has come to make another one videos, however I do not have any songs in mind. Can anyone have a listen to the two songs I mentioned above and recommend any similar songs that would be great for a soccer video but also fantastic to draw emotion and perhaps shed a tear? It would be fantastic!

I am hoping you can help me out. On my Twith channel I run a pre-live and a post-live slate before actually ""going live"". Music plays over this slate, and I am looking to add to the playlist of music I currently have set to play. 

I need copyright-safe music that I can use, preferably from labels with an open licensing policy (NCS or Ninety9Lives), or independent artists who allow open use of their tunes. 

I am looking for music that features real instruments, and prefer sax, trumpet, violin, and piano. I prefer no lyrics (but that's not a deal breaker) and I really love a more jazzy style (but am open to anything that simply features real instruments). 

I prefer melodic dubstep, chillstep, drumstep, drum &amp; bass, nudisco, and glitch hop/110bpm genre-wise. I don't want anything too hard/heavy/grimy. No hardstyle, house, or trap unless it specifically meets the requirements above.  

I know this is a pretty broad set of requirements, but do you think you guys can give me some recommendations?

Here are some examples of the kind of music I'm looking for:

Syntact - Shallow

Aaro - Sounds of My Imagination

Viceroy - Back at the Start

Fractal - Itvara

Griz - Hard Times

Elephante - Age of Innocence (Jenaux Remix)

Manoeuvres - Mad World (Station Earth Remix)

Nigel Good - Cine (actually, just pretty much anything from Nigel Good)

Flite - Blue Spark (and its VIP)

Pretty much anything from Joey Pecoraro

Said the Sky - Everything (I actually really love music with voiceovers like this)

Hybrid - Finished Symphony

San Holo - The Future (Feint Remix)

Basically anything from Goldfish

Feverkin - Golden

Far Out - Worlds Apart

Futuristik - Incomparable Flavour

TheFatRat - Monody

Tobu - Sapphire

1901,PSA: How to listen to HQ previews of the next day‚Äôs releases,"It just occurred to me while listening to a preview of one of tomorrow‚Äôs releases that other people might not know about how I do that. So, here goes. Ultimate hack to listen to a pretty large amount of songs up to a day before their release, that‚Äôs much easier than a vpn or account creation trickery if you don‚Äôt care about hearing the whole song.

1. Download iTunes on your computer (I haven‚Äôt figured out how to do it on the phone, and yes I know they‚Äôre phasing out iTunes which is just another reason to try this before that happens)

2. DON‚ÄôT log in to your account

3. Go to the bottom right corner and click on the flag, then pick a country like Fiji with a very far ahead time zone. 

4. It will think you are using it from there without an account, and you can access the iTunes previews of almost any song that comes out the next day. There‚Äôs some labels/songs that don‚Äôt work with this. But many songs can be streamed early this way.

I‚Äôve been using this method for over a year and hopefully y‚Äôall can benefit from it too if you don‚Äôt already have some fancy VPN or something.",EDM,1570642447,random-guy-on-reddit,0,1,True,2019-10-09

1905,Question about dancing at edm concerts/venues/festivals...,"Okay guys, so I just recently started going to EDM Venues, I‚Äôve seen nightmare &amp; slander, illenium, quite a few people I don‚Äôt listen to, but soon I‚Äôm going to fright night, and seeing San holo. Yeahhh babbbyy. 

I‚Äôm a terrible dancer, or at least I think so and I feel so awkward moving in clubs. My friends kept bugging me and I ended up dancing a little and they said I wasn‚Äôt half bad. 

Last ‚Äúclub‚Äù, or stage I should say we went to, there was this absolutely beautiful girl, and my friend kept telling me to go ask her to dance that she kept looking at me but I was to afraid to, also who knows if she even wanted to dance? Maybe she was just enjoying music by herself. 
 
Anyways, I wanted to hear from similar people who aren‚Äôt the best dancers, or weren‚Äôt. What did you do? Can you dance well now? Did you ever ask anyone to dance and what happened? Also any others with anxiety, how did you overcome it and are you happy you did? 

This might sound cheesy but I‚Äôm very open minded and I feel like other festival goers are more open minded then normal people, hence the drugs they take among other things. 

I‚Äôd love to meet someone that has the same interest as me, and at college there‚Äôs not really many people like that so it would make sense for me to meet someone at a festival. 

How do I ask someone to dance? How do I know If they want to? I‚Äôd honestly feel horrible asking someone who just wants to be left alone, not for fear of rejection but just the stigma other guys have, I‚Äôd never want to make anyone feel uncomfortable, and afterwards say she said no I‚Äôd feel bad even if I didn‚Äôt do anything to upset her, which I‚Äôd never try to do. I‚Äôm a good guy, really. 

Edm girl, if by chance you‚Äôre seeing this, I love you. Just kidding haha. 

Idk exactly what I want to get out of this post. Maybe advice, support or whatever else comes from it, I appreciate any replies or advice. Not a throwaway so please don‚Äôt stalk me and be the first to unravel my true identity. 

If this is the wrong place to post I‚Äôm sorry. Rock on my fellow edm lovers!",EDM,1570651958,Vysokojakokurva_C137,24,1,True,2019-10-09

Event Flyer if it helps your guess.  It's in alphabetical order so she's first.  I hope she's also last.

1966,Different club trends in different coutries,"Hi everyone!

I always keep wondering why there are specific trends and genres in different countries.
What I specifically mean is, I like in the UK for about 2 years. In Cornwall, for istance, the majority of clubs play Drum and Bass, classic House or Bass House. I couldn't find any place where the popular Big Room or basically EDM hits were played, exept some old hits, but let's not talk about it now.
Recently, I moved to Brighton and I can see simillar trends in here. You can find some Deep House/ Underground clubs. But barely anything related to EDM trends.
Why is Tomorrowland the biggest EDM festival, yet the biggest hits and DJs are barely recognized in here?
If let's say Spinnin, Armada, Musical Freedom etc. are one of the most popular labels and so are the DJs why it the music barely recognizable in the UK for example?
And it is not that I hate other genres but I would love to start playing in some clubs with simillar genre yet I find it impossible.

Just stood like statues and poker faces until he came on. the funny part is all these djs have very similar styles to seven lions. 

I get that they want to be front row for their favorite djs. I also get that they were there very early on to secure their spots. I‚Äôm also not in agreement that you need to be headbanging the entire set or you need to get off.

As the track ended, it had some creepy sound effect of a sound cord/plug being pulled directly out of the listeners ear.  The music sort of cut out and buzzed like a headphone/quarter-inch plug when it is removed, and you were left with the sound of blood dripping out of your ear and off the plug.

Bottles and liquids and Jesus, pick your religion

2120,"Decisions, decisions","I‚Äôm having a really difficult time choosing which show to go to coming up. I‚Äôm a mom of a 3 year old and a newborn so every event I go to is very very special and dear to me since it‚Äôs so rare for me to be able to. I have a ‚Äúbucket list‚Äù if you will of DJs I want to see and it just so happens 3 of them have shows coming up near me and I would really only be able to go to one unfortunately so I wanted to get on here and ask all of you fine people who maybe have already witnessed sets and could give opinions on which show I should choose. 

The first one is Tycho. My favorite artist out of the bunch. Now initially I would of chose Scott Hansen no doubt except this tour is for his new album ‚ÄúWeather‚Äù that features Saint Sinner in the majority of the project. Tycho typically doesn‚Äôt have vocals on his music so this whole album kind of flopped for me. Now that doesn‚Äôt mean he might not play other songs? But that‚Äôs my dilemma with that one. 

The second show up for debate is FREAKNIGHT! Oct 25th in Seattle. Now this is up in the air simply because the lineup hasn‚Äôt been released yet! But it‚Äôs Washington‚Äôs Halloween rave. I went last year they had Marshmello, Steve Aoki, Yellow Claw, Knife Party, Doctor P, whipped cream, etc it was lit. Now this comes with more artists and the fun of dressing up. But again, the mystery line up. Last year they waited until damn near October to release it. 

#3 KASKADE!!! October 19th Kaskade is my mother fucking vibe! And no! I have never seen his set before. I can close my eyes and imagine me rolling, dancing all night long. And that‚Äôs what I love to do. I enjoy the bass but I‚Äôm so much more of like an electric pixie than a bass head. *sigh* I just love kaskade. 

And lastly, Deadmau5 October 8th. Nope never have seen him either. But fuck I will dance all night long to some Deadmau5. And I know he will play some classics. Jaded, Strobe, fucking Ghosts n Stuff WTF. I know he‚Äôs a jackass, that‚Äôs my only dilemma lol.

-The first verse mentioned ‚Äúriding a white horse‚Äù (I think) (male vocals)

-It had a kinda complex house drop (not just the same few notes but a variety of notes I think)

-The second verse repeats the word ‚Äúb*tch‚Äù a lot

I've been struggling for weeks to add new songs to my playlist. Unfortunately, i can't find the specific sub-genre so my task gets a lot harder. I created a playlist to give you an idea of what i'm looking for : [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVGEO4NkssmUFBthYOCLREcH69TNeoXGR).

The overall pattern is :

* a build-up with a singer
* a drop around 1min
* good danceability on the chorus.
* No slow BPM (above 120)

I've listened to thousands of songs mainly from tropical house, pop edm, big room house... If you know the specific genre or just more songs for my playlist i would love it.

Thanks a lot.

Surrender might be the most beautiful vocal trance tune ever and they still play it to this day. That got me thinking, why not make a return of Tranquility Base? An album perhaps? That would be so luvely.

I feel like there hasn't been a huge leap or advancement in any other genre like Hip hop, or Pop, where I'd say that there hasn't been any huge change or difference for the past couple of years (with some exceptions like Lil Nas - Old Town road). 

But with EDM, there are constantly Artists who are extremely creative and bringing in their own unique sounds, making something that no one has literally ever heard of. Examples - Eliminate, Au5, Virtual Riot, etc.

2318,"It feels like Illenium and Marshmello are polar oposites, here's why:","First, I'm a all-rounder EDM listener, and I like both of them. The following lines are not meant to offend anyone, I'm just pointing out some things I've noticed.

Illenium's music is sad and melancholic while Marshmello's is happier and more upbeat.

Illenium is basically worshiped by the EDM community while Marshemello is disliked.

Illenium's music is 100% EDM, with some different tracks here and there (e.g Crashing), while Marshmello's is mostly poppy, and he releases some actual EDM now and then (e.g. the Joytime albums)

Illenium is praised for becoming what he is today, despite his early life being difficult, while Marshmello is considered a sell-out because his current music is not as good as his old one, ans because he seeked money and fame.

Illenium is pretty unknow to non-EDM fans, while Marshmello usually hits the Top 40.",EDM,1562207742,M1841,18,5,True,2019-07-03

So I stumbled upon this track, [We Are Mirage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OESG9076H-g), and I'm pretty sure it was huuge back in the day. Used to listen to it a lot but had completely forgotten of its existence for a few years, until today...

2420,Boris Brejcha - My Best Unanticipated Artist Discovery At A Festival,"Hey guys!

&amp;#x200B;

As the title reads, I'm curious to hear what YOUR biggest and most addictive artist discovery at a music festival has been to date. Please share below as it may have been you walking past a stage to get food or see a planned act and on your way there - you heard very enticing sounds from an artist you never knew before that were irresistible and your love for that certain sound/artist grew from then onwards.

For me personally, I attended TML Weekend 2 last year and I was really feeling the Core Stage in the woods from the day before, so I wanted to go back the next day. I was also probably looking for a girl that I met in DreamVille and wanted to see her again...but then I walked past Atmosphere Stage and Boris Brejcha was playing üòç despite listening to electronic music since 2006, I never knew of this Boris person. I've always liked progressive/deep/tech/future house as well as trance, and properly got into techno quite late (around 2016). I've listened to the likes of Solomun, Sven Vath, Carl Cox, Tale Of Us, Stephan Bodzin, Adam Bayer, Ritchie Hawtin &amp; Nina Kraviz since but I never knew of Boris...

Funny enough, I momentarily contemplated missing Yotto at Core and stood at the Atmosphere entrance for a minute or two. But I've always wanted to see Yotto over the years as such artists never make their way across to perform in South Africa so I involuntarily went to Core eventually. Haha

But since then, I've been so curious about this Boris Brejcha artist and WOW! I'm blown away by how epic he truly is üôåüèΩ his production is INSANE. His transitions on decks is beyond seamless as well as sublime and I LOVE his unique style of minimal techno...it's a non-generic sound that I can't properly describe or put a finger on. I'm embarrassed and confused as to how I did not know of him before. I cannot stop rewatching his TML 2018 set on YouTube - I've broken the replay button on it if I must admit!

Is there a 2018 TML set with more views than his? Because it's currently on 18Million which is tons! It makes sense - his skills are astounding and he has such a bouncy and infectious energy while playing. What's most lovely is the fact that he is doing it all without the need to talk through the microphone nor ask the crowd to have their hands up/jump to the beat. It's purely a musical journey.

It's also awesome how my music taste has changed over the years as I used to love the dj engaging with the crowd and participating in crowd sit-downs etc. Now I'm all about the dreamy musical journeys and no talking during sets.",EDM,1559745466,WilstaMorgan,14,12,True,2019-06-05

2443,A message in response to Mixmag,"""tribute bootlegs: ‚Äòhomages‚Äô to artists who would probably rather you didn‚Äôt pay them respect by bouncing on something they‚Äôve spent weeks or months making. This ranges from the painfully tasteless ‚Äòtribute‚Äô bootlegs for artists who have passed away (such as the recent stream of possibly well-intentioned ‚Äòhomages‚Äô to Keith Flint)""

The Prodigy released their stems for a remix, many like mine were released a month before Keith's unexpected suicide and became tributes thereafter. I spent a lot of time deciding whether or not to pull The Surgery remix out of respect but by that point it was already being aired. There's no mention on the wave of disgusting soul-less clothing bootleggers which fully deserve at least a sentence of shame here over remix producers that got caught up in this. Whether the rest of The Prodigy like the tracks or not I'm sure they will appreciate those fans who wanted to add a message of support. Out to the Viunytskyis at Agressor Bunx, the Boom Boom Tap remix is top. How about we remember the time Mixmag accused ""Charly"" of being tragic and quote ""a nail in the coffin for rave music"" and let Liam and the boys decide how is appropriate for their fans to pay their respects.

2510,Bassnectar - Bass Head (Similar songs),"I'm going to say this....

Dubstep is an awesome genre of music and when you find those diamonds in the rough you keep an eye out for similar tracks.

&amp;#x200B;

Example: Bassnectar - Bass Head

This is a fantastic dubstep song that feels like a story almost because it just has a complex melody but keeps you interested. It's also not just a bunch of random noises that get old really quick. ALSO it's no so fast that you cant even keep up either lol

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to find more ""fine tuned"" dubstep songs such as these.

Bassnectar, Seven Lions, and Adventure Club have been my favorites since like 2011

***


This month presented us with a plethora of incredible tracks. This list is probably my most diverse in terms of sound, which makes me feel good since it‚Äôs forcing me to listen to stuff that I wouldn‚Äôt normally listen to. I won‚Äôt waste your time anymore, let‚Äôs get right into it. 


HM: Internet Boy (feat. Micah Martin) ‚Äì Dion Timmer|Foreign Land ‚Äì DESERT STAR|Demon Hunter ‚Äì PhaseOne &amp; Subtronics|Star Allies ‚Äì Spencer Brown &amp; Raito





**5) Work It Out ‚Äì A-Trak [House]**


This disco and funk infused house track radiates summer vibes. Ever since I heard this at BnL Miami, I was in love with the funky bassline and smooth chorus-style vocals. Ideal track to add to your summer playlist.

[YouTube] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQo0tXv3oug)



**4) Crash &amp; Burn (feat. Northlane) ‚Äì PhaseOne [Metalstep]**

Absolute BELTER of a track. Beginning with the shy and ominous vocals, and perfectly transitions into the heavy, metal-infused build up and midsection. This is saying something because I am not a fan of metal vocals at all, and this track makes them actually work. This track is a heavy hitter and nothing less.

[YouTube] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mrZBwp8gfQ)



**3) Flood ‚Äì Effin [Freeform Bass]**


Effin‚Äôs Operate EP has its fair share of solid tracks, and Flood is by far a great example of that. The grimey, glitchy first drop followed by the MASSIVE second drop are absolute banger material. The off-beat style perfectly compliments the trap-dubstep infused style.

[YouTube] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd_deE9phEc)




**2) New Dawn (Club Mix) ‚Äì Jason Ross [Trouse]**


Cinematic beauty. As a closer, this track is nothing short of perfect. The airy strings carry you up in anticipation and the melodic drop finishes the job beautifully. When I heard him close with this on tour in Orlando, it was absolutely breathtaking. As always, incredible work by Ross, and I know for a fact he will be on this list a few more times in the future. (seriously dude please release [Known You Before] (https://youtu.be/hpYcNGOLORU))

[YouTube] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuCKi51a6Bc)



**1) End Of All Things (In My Next Life Mix) ‚Äì Andrew Bayer &amp; Alison May [Progressive House]**


I don‚Äôt know any words that can accurately describe but this track, let alone this whole album, but I‚Äôll try; immaculate. In all honesty, a good portion of this album could be my number 1 track this month, but for variety and fairness sake, I just picked my favorite from the album. Don‚Äôt let the video game-y intro fool you; this track is an absolute stunner. The smooth tri-chord with the church-like vocals and the slow, gradual buildup to the drop is absolute euphoria. This song almost males me tear up every time it comes on; it just has that power. I HIGHLY recommend listening to this album, it is definitely one of the best of this year so far, and probably will remain in the future.

2564,Why was ‚Äúsnob‚Äù reserved for house and tech heads?,"I‚Äôve come across people calling house and tech heads as house ‚Äúsnobs‚Äù and tech ‚Äúsnobs‚Äù, and even heard one of my good friend who‚Äôs really into house refer to herself as a house snob proudly. So is it something that is usually reserved for house and tech music? 

Genuinely curious, as someone who has tried really hard to get into what you consider ‚Äútrue‚Äù house music but really can‚Äôt and questions how ‚Äúrefined‚Äù my taste is. On the flip side, I really dig electro-house, trance house, big room house, future house, tropical house and some progressive house. I really could not deal with bass house or tech house for more than 1 minute without getting instantly bored. I‚Äôve tried as hard as I could, even forcing myself to sit through a green velvet and deadmau5 set but I just could not get hyped. I even listened to Chris lake, Adam Bayer, Fisher... still couldn‚Äôt get into it.. 

I‚Äôm genuinely curious about what makes house and tech considered as the superior of all edm, is it because that was what first originated? 
I‚Äôve noticed people usually look down on djs that produce more melodic/pop/future bass stuff? Especially the ones that become popular like illenium, zedd, marshmello, etc. What makes certain songs considered bad, while what makes others good? 

I‚Äôve also noticed some house heads saying they do not like big room/future house at all. So is it basically anything that has more of a mainstream appeal/mixing of genres instantly unlikable?

Before All You Need To Know came out I didn't hear any preview/live/early version, and I didn't have any idea about what the song will be like, and when it was released, I was pleasantly surprised.

2608,Question pertaining to EDM (&amp; artists like Datsik),"Hey guys, I'm quite new to the EDM scene and I have a question for all of your hardcore fans out there. I've been looking around at some different artists and I'm having trouble pinpointing exactly what  I'm looking for. Basically, without getting too long winded... I REALLY like a lot Datsik's beats, however I'm not a huge fan of the overwhelming dubstep drops. So I guess I'll break it down into two questions:  


1) Is there a specific sub-genre for what I've described? I've looked into both Drum &amp; Bass and Hardstyle a bit, but neither of them seem to quite fit the bill. Most of the beats I've found that I really enjoy were from Dubstep artists such as Datsik, Excision and Skism... but they always seem to lose me a bit once they wander into that screechy, overpowering dubstep drop territory.   
2) Does anybody who understands what I'm looking for have any artists they could suggest I have a look at?

Glitch, funky and filtered along with a few oddities, hip hop and downtempo influenced tracks. Maybe a few proto French House from Motorbass and into the Electro and bands that had remixes and collaborations like Air and Pheonix and beyond with Bot'ox and more.

Daft Punk and their friends, Alex Gopher and Ettienne Des Cresy, Demon, Wuz, I:Cube, Chateau Flight, Rob, The Eternals, Mr Learn, Dimitri, Cassius and many many more will pop up.

2650,Can we have an actual discussion of music?,"I was over on r/trap and in response to the new Nitti Gritti/Yookie track someone posted this:

It's alright. Not really a fan of that snare. Idk I just can't get behind Yookie's often skeletal, staticky approach, or their emphasis on giant wonky wubs mixed with high-pitched, screechy synths/risers. They've got some cool sound design and decent intros that give their tracks this cinematic feel but the drops and midsections are always lackluster to me. Not really sure what Nitti added here either, just sounds like another Yookie track. I think they're capable of creating interesting music, like there are moments in a few of their songs where I think ""ok, that was pretty dope"". They need to push the envelope more tho, experiment with other sounds, and not rely so much on empty space. Idk just my thoughts

This kind of criticism is so valuable to both an audience and an artist. It highlights his opinion, why he feels this way and his suggestion. I understand that not everyone has the time to do this but please stop just saying stupid answers like ""(generic future bass artist) is life changing you have to go!!!!1!1!1!!1!1! ""

2691,Getter is completely overreacting to the negative reception from Visceral and is ruining his image as an artist.,"To preface, I have been a dedicated fan of Getter's acting and music for a few years now.  One observation I have made during these years is that he does not respond well to criticism.  He has a habit of responding to tweets from people that bash on his music.  I understand that it's difficult to receive harsh criticism on your passion project, but the majority of people have been extremely supportive of the new album/tour.

Does anyone remember this time last year when Getter said he was quitting EDM completely??  He had a whole huge outburst on it on Twitter that went on for days, until he changed his mind... 6 months later, Visceral is released.

Anyone who makes their art public receives criticism, music or otherwise.  It's part of being an artist.

The main defense for Getter's social media outburst is that people were booing him/throwing items on stage.  If anyone has seen K?D before he was poppin, the same shit happened to him!!  He got booed offstage when he opened for Jauz in NY and on a few other occasions (granted, his mixing was shite), but he handled it well and now plays dope sets.  

Cancelling the tour and making long whiny posts on all of his socials is a really bad move for him here.  It comes off as attention seeking and unprofessional, not to mention he has likely angered many paying customers who were counting down the days until their chance to see Visceral.

At the beginning (or end?) of the music video there is a man acting like he's swimming (maybe drowning?) There is also a shot in the video of the DJ in front of a bright coloured background (I think it was red) and he was working the turntables. I remember it being slightly fisheye'd but I could be wrong. I also feel like there may have been some sort of McDonalds logo on his shirt or something like that.

2834,When your entire perspective and feeling towards an artist's music changes in one day...,"I was never much of a Bassnectar fan; I always thought his work was kinda...gimmick-y. Like, ""how much bass can I slam into a song before it becomes intolerable?"" And so, over the years, I've basically avoided listening to him, and I've always been so mystified as to why he has the cult-like following that he does.

I stumbled across ""Unlimited"" today at work whilst browsing some Spotify playlists. I decided I'd give the first track (Reaching Out) a chance and see what he's up to these days.

Fuck. This album is so fucking good. It's been 13 hours since I turned it on and it's been on repeat the entire fucking day. Oh my god. And ""Into The Sun"" is also just blowing my fucking face off.

I guess my point in making this post is that letting any kind of preconceived notions about an artist prevent you from actually listening to that artist is a huge disservice, and can keep you from discovering some great music. Bassnectar has completely scratched an itch for me that I didn't even know was there, and I'll be listening to him exclusively for the next few days as I work back through his older stuff.

To Bassnectar and his fans: I'm sorry so naive and stereotyped y'all without actually sitting down and listening. This shit is like sex for my ears.

Unfortunately, I can't remember any other song on that mix(other than Elk Road's Whipped Dream,) and I feel like this particular remix has been wiped off the face of the planet. 

I can't find it ANYWHERE. 

The only remix I've been able to find that even comes close is the one from Twerkillaz, but only because the tempo is similar, if not an exact match. I guess besides the one I'm looking for, they were the only ones who thought the original sounded good sped up, idfk.

The search is only made that much harder because that specific Droog's (not Droox) Mix was made private or deleted, not to mention the complete saturation of remixes, edits, and bootlegs for this damn song.

The reason I feel like I didn't imagine this whole thing is because Whipped Dream has been in my top tunes since that time, and that Droog's Mix was the first place I ever heard it.

The producers on Spinnin are not aiming for something different or unique when they are producing Psy trance. It's more like they just want it to have the same triplets and vocal chops you heard for the past three years.

Monstercat might be a bit better in terms of psy trance since they signed Infected Mushroom, but then again it's not like they're supporting psytrance or even regular trance producers. Their has been maybe 2-3 trance tracks on Monstercat and even thou they got positive reviews, Monstercat just doesn't want to risk it.

Me personally usually sticks to Iboga Records in terms of psytrance since they have some variety. Hopefully they start their radioshow again. Am more into really long and trippy vibes.

2900,"Differences between trap &amp; future bass, and future bass &amp; melodic dubstep?","What's makes these genres distinctive? They seem to be very closely related.

for example: 
trap &amp; future bass - is DROLOE trap or future bass? most well known future bass tracks sound more similar to melodic dubstep. future bass is also sometimes known as ""heaven trap"" and has many similarities. i believe it's widely accepted that DROLOE is mostly future bass, but why so? It feels like trap to me.

futute bass &amp; melodic dubstep - what makes Seven Lions melodic dubstep and not future bass? it is widely accepted that Seven Lions is a melodic dubstep artist (which i personally also tag him as); however, why can't he be classified as future bass?
is Illenium melodic dubstep or future bass? i've heard Illenium being tagged as both.

There's a EDM spot in my city, and I just go there every couple of weeks or so by myself and have a good time dancing to the music.

I find that the overwhelming majority of people come in groups or at least as a couple. I'm interested in actually having friends who share this hobby. Trouble is, I'm pretty busy with work in general, so EDM is one of the only times I actually go out! I've found it's very hard to talk to people at the event itself, because the music is so freaking loud!

It's not something that people openly admitted for probably the last 10 years: but I love it.

Honestly I think *just about* all of their instumentals alone would make a fantastic, somewhat oldschool EDM/trance album. 

But the problem is finding instrumental versions of their more popular, lyric-heavy tracks. A few exist from regular production like Nessaja and Maria, but there's plenty that I would kill to just have the lyrics taken out and nothing more such as The Chaser and Take a Break. I know it's a far fetched request, but does anyone have any resources to strip vocals for my own aural pleasure? Or even any dusty old links?

***

HM) Island (feat. Nevve) ‚Äì Seven Lions, Wooli, &amp; Trivecta [leaked in December 2018]

**5) Wild Wild Son (Richard Durand Remix) ‚Äì Armin van Buuren feat. Sam Martin [Trance]

As someone who was looking for something more from the original version of Wild Wild Son, this Remix breathes new life into this track by focusing more on the track itself than on the vocals. The Remixed version adds more melodic synths to the drop and midsections. Overall a solid remix and improvement from the original version. 

**4) Kids ‚Äì LIONE feat. Miranda Glory [Future Bass]

LIONE continues his unique style of future bass mixed with chip-tuney elements that add up to make a great emotional track. LIONE has always done a superb job of complimenting the vocals on his tracks, and this track is no different. I personally like the 2nd half of the drops more than the first, which have that euphoric, spacey feel to them. Hopefully he releases more throughout the year compared to last, but this is a solid start to the year nonetheless. 

**3) Imaginary Friends (i_o Hack) ‚Äì deadmau5 [Progressive House/Techno]

This i_o Remix is what all remixes should strive to be; an original sound that incorporates key elements of the original track. I think that i_o does a masterful job of executing this idea in the track, turning the progressive house banger into a ‚Äútechno‚Äù force. I personally can‚Äôt wait to see what i_o does throughout the year.

**2) Flying By Candlelight (Club Mix) ‚Äì Above &amp; Beyond feat. Marty Longstaff [Progressive House]

Above &amp; Beyond delivers yet another stellar club mix of one of their own tracks. With a similar style to their Another Chance Club Mix, euphoric vocals and midsections build up to a progressive drop with melodic synths. I‚Äôm a huge fan of chords in the style that are used in this track, and they are used perfectly in this track. I hope A&amp;B use this style more often in the future.

**1) Run With The Wolves ‚Äì Wildestylez &amp; E-Life [Hardstyle]

This track is full of pure energy that makes it impossible to keep still to. The melodic lead synths paired with the heavy hardstyle kicks makes it a perfect festival track to get the crowd moving. I haven‚Äôt been able to get this track out of my head ever since it released (1/25), which is actually a relatively long time for me to still be addicted to a singular track. Especially for someone who doesn‚Äôt listen to hardstyle all that often, this track is a pure masterpiece and one of my favorite hardstyle tracks.

Cross-post from r/edmproduction

A friend and I have started up a music review platform, in which expert reviewers can listen to tracks anonymously and provide feedback, stratifying tracks based on quality as opposed to popularity. This way, underexposed artists can compare themselves with the industry standard.

It's a slow start but we've started getting our first few submissions.

We're throwing out a call for reviewers - ideally with special interest in a few genres within electronic music. At this point we also need people to look through hip-hop submissions so if you have a crossover interest that'd be amazing.

A good peer-reviewer should be as objective as possible, with some knowledge of the production process and industry. We're hoping to build a community around a reliable core group of peers.

\*also if you want to submit a track for review, feel free!\*

2961,"I'm obsessed with a song, looking for recommendations.","A few months back I stumbled across this song:

Monochrome MT - Indica (I don't know Genre and Year) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGxFnlXZTqw

I just can't get over it. It gives me chills every time and I listed to it a few times every day. It's not even on Spotify and has super low views on YouTube, so I'm guessing it's a niche sort of sound? I'm just wondering if there are other songs like this?

I'll try to explain what I like. The beginning of the song is peaceful and it lulls you into this relaxed state, then after minute 4 it starts subtly showing this weird sound that gets louder and louder until at around 4:38 everything goes silent except for that weird sound, and you expect that sound to end early but it goes on for much longer than you're used to and then the bass hits you. Full body chills first time I listen to it every day. It's disgusting how good it is. Then that beat and the bass sort of dance for a while, sometimes the beat skips and that's nice too. I don't know any musical terms, so I don't know what the guys are doing there but I'd just like more of that.

You should see the number of files on my computer from exporting the final mix so many times. I would stay up until 5 a.m. at times grinding out the project, just to stop having to worry about it.

\-I designed every synth sound with my own two hands using serum 

\-If my PC for some reason shuts down during the night or my dad unplugs it while I'm at school to ""save energy"" I would immediately lose all my hard work

\-I wasn't able to take any breaks off the project when I got a writers block

\-Being away from my room with the project open in general made me a little nervous because at any point in time my work could be erased 

\-In order to make unique patterns (u FL goons know what I mean) I would have to get a new pattern and merge it with an existing one

\-vocals and vocal chops and any type of wav sample were hell to deal with because of not being able to make unique patterns

&amp;#x200B;

However, he has always been regarded as one of the best and iconic DJ's of the planet ( not a music producer) who knows how to impress the crowd. So last year I attended an EDM event where Tiesto was a main act, and KSHMR was a support DJ, and I really expected something super special from a Dutch DJ legend.

Unfortunately, his performance did not really impress the crowd including myself that night. He played numerous songs of different genres and subgenres: Big room house, bass house, progressive house, trance, electro house, trap, future house, future bass...... but that was kinda basic considering the level of a DJ. He played almost every track from its intro to its outro, and I really felt like the set was losing energy after every transition.... Like.... he did not even "" tell the story "" in his set. Felt like a random mix of popish edm songs form various artists.

Maybe I am just wrong, but I got really into electronic music and watched some interviews of other iconic DJ's and producers such as Laidback Luke, and when they list their list of top DJ's, they always put Tiesto somewhere on the top of that list, however, his live set was almost nothing in comparison to, for example, Arty (another Dj I got to see last year), who was also mixing tracks of various electronic and non-electronic genres, and he made it sound sick (even despite he made a couple of beatmatching mistakes).

During the year, it became possible to observe the growing popularity of this sound, as well as the growing popularity of the main representatives of the  dark midtempo (for example, this year was productive for REZZ). Also 3lau recently released a track in this style in Ninjawerks album. The popular magazine YOUREDM.com, by tradition, at the end of the year, named producers that we should follow next year.

3135,[Help] Wrong place in the wrong time!,"I am a 19 year old teenager from India who opened up a Reddit account just a couple of days ago to follow certain subreddits, some related to electronic music because I happen to love it. 

Yesterday someone named /u/jackthelisker posted a thread on r/EDM on which he asked people's opinions on his ""new track"" that I stumbled upon and gave a listen (just the 1st minute or so). I found it decent so I wrote ""nice pop song"" on the comments and he replied saying he appreciated that.

I woke up this morning, to my surprise, found a flurry of downvotes in my comments. I looked it up and as I understand it, people are accusing this dude of creating alt accounts and thus committing an act of self-commendation... and they think that my account is one of those alt accounts, because all those alts are 1-2 days old as well. (mother of all coincidences!!)

1.If I try to convince them that I'm really not him, I'm a different guy from a different place; *they don't believe me and keep downvoting every comment I made since I joined Reddit.*
2.If I delete my account now, *it will appear as if I am actually him trying to falsely make them believe that it's not an alt, but eventually not being able to do it and deleting this alt account afterwards to ""keep my hands clean"".*

I am asking for help in this matter to you guys. Hope someone understands and tells me what I should do to prove I'm not that guy and completely innocent.

3156,"[SATIRE] 8 new interesting EDM labels you probably haven't heard of! (Made this for r/Monstercat but thought you guys might enjoy, too!)","Good day, EDM fans! This is your favorite EDM news source, *EDMohyeahEDMyeahbaby.com*, with a hot new trend that seems to be sweeping the globe. New distribution labels seem to be popping up left and right, and we wanted to showcase eight fresh new innovative labels looking to shake the scene. So here you have it; 8 new, up and coming EDM labels.

#1/2. *""to"" Records/""the"" Records*
Artist and producer Hayden Capuozzo, also known as ""Kayzo"", has previous launched his two labels ""Doghouse Recordings"" and ""Welcome Records"". Though initially pleased with his two labels, Kayzo later decided he wanted to increase his reach even further and decided to found his 3rd and 4th labels, ""to"" Records and ""the"" Records. 

Kayzo has commented that the purpose of these new labels is to complete one of his signature phrases, ""Welcome to the doghouse!"", through the use of individual record labels. Fans have also theorized that similar to Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"" album, all of the releases from ""Welcome Records"" will continuously flow into ""To Records"", and so on. 

Kayzo has also announced the premiere releases on each label. ""Welcome to My House"" is a collaboration between Kayzo and CRAY detailing their intimate personal life on ""To Records"", while ""The Records"" is expected to launch yet another ""THE DROP"" remix package.

#3. *BAD Vibrations*
After beef between former best friends ""SLANDER"" and ""NGHTMRE"", artist and DJ duo SLANDER have decided to split apart from their recently created label ""GUD Vibrations"" in order to create a mocking ""BAD Vibrations"". 

Despite the ill intent behind the name, SLANDER assures they are serious about the label. BAD Vibrations' first release is set to be an EP from artist Wavedash, who they *insist* was not bribed against former friend NGHTMRE.

#4. *Nerd City*
After continuously amassing over 1 million streams on Spotify and building a large following of fans, the DJ duo known as the ""Pegboard Nerds"" have decided to build their own label. Given the increase in popularity, the Nerds thought it was time to branch off.

When asked about plans for future release, the Nerds responded as such. ""Oh, we're not going to actually release anything on it. It just seems like every popular artist feels the need to make their own label. We plan on doing literally nothing at all with it. In fact, we'll probably keep releasing on Monstercat with occasional releases with our pals at Disciple."" There you have it - the future is bright for Pegboard Nerds fans!

#5. *Pro Toaster Media*
Artist ""Protostar"" survived a nearly fatal assassination attempt from a rabid fan. [Pictured here](https://youtu.be/bmGED4gMG8M), the terrifying video captures a deadly attack on Protostar's life. Following the assault, Protostar found it best to distance himself from the Monstercat label, and founded his own label for publishing and distribution, ""Pro Toaster Media"".

We were able to have a conversation with Protostar about his new venture.

**Interviewer**: ""So, Protostar, how are you feeling about the future of your new label?""

**Protostar**: ""What? What new label? Who are you?""

**Interviewer**: ""What kind of releases can we expect to see from Pro Toaster Media?""

**Protostar**: ""I'm calling the police. Please get out of my house.""

We're expecting big things!

#6. *Carsh Records*
Following overwhelming commercial success, superstar artist ""FWLR"" has decided to create a label for releases from him and his loyal fans. The label is projected to be one of the hottest sources for new EDM music, attracting the attention of mega artists Skrillex, deadmau5, and Marshmello.

There is a unique catch to FWLR's label, however. All release must be related to FWLR's ""carsh"", a distorted version of FWLR's prized possession: his car. In fact, all releases must be called ""carsh"". Despite these strict publication requirements, artists are lining up left and right to be the first artist on FWLR's new label.

#7. *City of OZ Mandatory Listening and Observance*
Attention, citizens. All citizens will be REQUIRED to tune in to the City of OZ's premiere audio broadcast. The broadcast will last approximately 60 minutes, and a new broadcast will launch exactly after the previous broadcast first. This will continue until further notice. It is expected that all citizens will listen to each broadcast - failing to follow these instructions will lead to subjugation through government forces, followed by execution through vaporization. It should be noted that turning down the volume on your government-installed audio production device, or leaving the vicinity of your device, is considered as failing to mentally ""listen"".

#8. *Monstercat: bitbird*
After the commerical success and positive reception behind launching sublabels ""Instinct"" and ""Uncaged"", EDM label Monstercat has decided to launch a third sublabel: ""bitbird"". ""Monstercat: bitbird"" is expected to bring the big guns to their debut, launching with LP ""album1"" by artist San Holo, ""The Choices We Face EP"" from duo DROELOE, as well as ""Minds EP"" from Taska Black.

However, some artists have come out, citing the new sublabel as ""blatant plagiarism"". In response, CEO Mike Darlington said, ""nah fam."" Given his unbreakable and unbeatable defense, critics have stepped down and accepted the new sublabel.

Are you excited for more from these labels? We sure are! Have a wonderful day, and make sure not to choke on all these delicious EDM patties!",EDM,1545244704,PrometheanSigma,2,1,True,2018-12-19

3160,FUTURE of PROGRESSIVE HOUSE style,"Progressive House (Mainstream, Big room, festival prog) has become one of the most adorable styles of electronic music. For many, it is associated with the golden time for the genre, the flourishing of edm. For me, this is the style that introduced me to electronic music. In my opinion this is a very emotional sound that can cause sincere feelings. The fact that many want to return those golden days shows the value of a progressive house for the whole EDM.Perhaps due to this style, electronic music finally gained global popularity. After Swedish House Mafia reunion , many began to talk about the possible return of the popularity of the prog. On the one hand, this seems quite possible. There are many talented producers who, such as Third Party, Matisse and Sadko, Dimitri Vangelis &amp; Wyman and others. Martin Garrix progressive house music videos gain from 50 million to 100 mln views  (but this is more likely because of his name).On the other hand, the style does not develop and it sounds the same. Is it possible to improve, modify this style in order to get something like a continuation, Progressive House 2.0. What do you think about that? Is everything invented for this style? Will Progressive House just be a good memory?",EDM,1545255464,MichaelBravoo,6,1,True,2018-12-19

Openers: The openers for this show were Eastghost, Duskus, and Taska Black. Overall I was actually very impressed with all three of them. Eastghost in particular threw down some nasty beats and even with limited lighting and audio abilities (being the opener of the night obviously he is unable to have full force with light shows, subs, etc.) he managed to give a really good performance and get the crowd pretty into his showing. Duskus provided exactly what I expected and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Taska Black came out with more energy then I felt like San Holo did. He came out with a solid lift show and did some amazing remixes (his remix of ‚ÄòAll I Do Is Win‚Äô definitely had the crowd moving and dancing). Overall this was honestly some of the most fun I‚Äôve ever had with openers since getting into the EDM scene. All three came out with a lot of energy and it felt like they had something to prove. By the end of Black‚Äôs set I was very energized and hyped for the show to go on. 

San Holo‚Äôs Set: San Holo‚Äôs Album1 tour defiantly hyped up Salt Lake City, as he came on stage announcing that the show was sold out. Production wise I was pretty impressed. This wasn‚Äôt my first time seeing him and he has defiantly up‚Äôd his budget for lighting and sound quality. When it comes to his actual performance...this is were I am torn. I love His music and I believe that he defiantly has potential to eventually headline some major festivals in the future. However, I feel like he needs to work on his crowd interaction and overall decide what kind of DJ he wants to be. His songs were constantly switching from what could have been very vibey and chill to a full out rock guitar? The transition between was NOT smooth and felt forced and choppy. The entire show felt this way and many of the people around me seemed to get almost bored with the lack of power and force behind his drops. It felt like he would have these amazing and beautiful build up‚Äôs, just to have them completely broken down by the interruption of a rock in roll guitar over his usually melodic beats. Overall I still had a good time and enjoyed the performance, but I truly think he needs to pick one: the guitar sound or full on DJ sets. Because together they are nothing to write home about. 

Conclusion: Overall I would give this performance a 6.5/10. The openers defiantly have bright futures ahead of them and I would really love to see EastGhost and Taska Black in different settings than this. As for San Holo, I believe that his potential is as high as he sets for himself. If he finds a way to incorporate this guitar sound in a smoother and more melodic fashion I would love to keep him keep it. Yet, if he wants to go for the heavier DJ sound I think that the guitar needs to go. I would recommend this show to anybody who was able to get tickets for a low price ($30 or under), but I would NOT pay 3rd party seller prices for San Holo. Not until he fixes the problems with his sets, that I believe he is putting on himself. L",EDM,1544688313,Collinstuhl7,5,1,True,2018-12-13

3215,Electric Family Screwed Me Over.. STAY AWAY,"I've never dealt with anything like this.

So I bought a 10-pack of combo bracelets for &gt; $80 from them (all as presents for my friends). I noticed the GWN one was out of stock, but could still be purchased in the combo for some reason so I got it. It's the only dubstep act my one friend really likes so I got it for him as his b-day gift. 2 weeks go by and nothing... no order confirmation... no shipping... no email saying your order has been delayed... JUST NON-STOP PROMOTIONAL EMAILS...nothing of substance. I email them inquiring about my order. As expected they tell me ""there were manufacturing issues with a few bracelets in your order"" aka the GWN was out of stock and we accidentally sold you one. I say that's fine just send me what you have and send the rest later that's all I want. They even agreed to toss a tchami bracelet in for me. Then when they sent the order they just subbed my GWN one for Tchami and I got the package. I got shipping info when it sent and everything... awesome they got their shit together, right? Nah, they must've just hoped I'd forget about it or something because I never received an order-related email for another month. I reached back out and they told me it shipped but was forwarded to a different address and I should reach out to USPS. What the fuck... 2 MONTHS FOR A BRACELET (and this was the one that motivated me to start buying these for my friends in the first place). I got the first order and the address was right, plus it's literally just a normal house. So obviously EF fucked up and put the wrong shipping info on and have now gone radio silent. They won't respond to me at all and it just really rubs me the wrong way. They pretend to be about giving back, but honestly didn't give a fuck about me... they just kept hoping I'd forget about it... Never have I ever received worse customer service for how quick they were to originally respond. Anyone else have similar experiences? I know I'm being a diva, but I care about my friends, and I actually spent a lot of money on their products.

3268,"ATL crew, come visit us over at r/atlantaedm and join us for a meetup this Friday before Shiba San!"," 

Hey ATL electric fans,

Over the past few months, the electronic music community in Atlanta has been booming and we are lucky to have a really devoted group of mods, users, and promoters over on [r/Atlantaedm](https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlantaedm) focused on hosting meetups and events. This Friday, we are planning on holding a community meetup at [Ravine](https://www.facebook.com/RavineATL/) in Midtown before the [Shiba San](https://soundcloud.com/shibasan) show as the promoters have agreed to open the space earlier than normal to host us at 9:30!

‚Äã

I would really like to encourage anybody looking to hang out with a group of down to earth people who enjoy all types of electronic music to come. It's a great opportunity to meet new peeps and get to know those who are involved with curating the scene in Atlanta. Since Ravine will be open early, it will give everybody a chance to make connections with music starting a little later around 10. My partner Sean and I ([Gad'm](https://www.instagram.com/gadmgood/?hl=en)) will be opening with some groovy tunes before Shiba comes on, and we can't wait to meet with everyone before and after our set.

‚Äã

Come leave a comment and RSVP in the Meetup Thread!

3297,Black Friday Unlimited EDM Festival Passport!,"Unity Travel posted this online and I thought I would share!

For Black Friday/Cyber Monday they just released their Secret VIP Sale to the public.

You can find it here: https://secure.unity.travel/events/unity-passes/products 

Basically, you have two options:
1) 777 pass (for $777 after taxes) you get 3 VIP passes to 3 music festivals they partner with for 1 year.
2) Unlimited pass ($999) you get VIP festival passes to ANY music festival they partner with for 1 year.

Plus, the sale includes discounts on hotel rooms, shuttle passes, camping, vip tables, etc.

I thought it was a really great deal because after you attend 2 events, it pretty much just paid itself off. Festivals included are: Paradiso, Imagine, Ever After, Das Energy, Spring Awakening, Lucky, Big Dub, Bass Camp, FeakNight, Resolution, Radiance, Decadence NYE, and more.

Like, if you live in the PNW and attend a lot of USC events raves, you pay the $999 and that gives you VIP Tickets to like 6 or however many fests they offer. Or if you live in SLC area and go to alot of the V2 Presents Events (Das Energi, Get Lucky, Get Freaky, etc)

Also, they have payment plans, so you don't have to pay the lump sum all at once.

Anyway, thought I would share this with my favorite Reddit community!

3344,Tracklist2Spotify.com is Back Up!,"Howdy folks, sorry to post this again but everything crashed and burned last time so this has probably been long forgotten. This is essentially a re-post of my [last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDM/comments/9rvapt/turn_your_favorite_youtube_mixes_into_spotify/), with a small twist... 


In case you missed the first thread, Tracklist2Spotify is a small webapp with one purpose: to take your tracklists from Youtube videos and turn them into Spotify playlists.

Unfortunately, on the last post, I discovered it had a bug regarding logging in with Spotify, but it's been patched and tested. The URL is (still) http://www.tracklist2spotify.com (https will redirect shortly).


Anyway, in the last thread, someone asked if this could handle YouTube playlists. Well I'm happy to announce that along with the bug fix that got it going again, Tracklist2Spotify now also supports Youtube playlist links! Now, you can paste a playlist URL like the one below:

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL57AAB2DBE253E35F

And Tracklist2Spotify will automatically pull in the titles of all the videos found on the playlist. I added this feature this morning and it works great. Only caveat is it will only fetch the first 100 videos in the playlist - I'll be working on a fix for this as soon as possible.

In the meantime, go ahead and turn your favorite EDM megamixes and playlists into Spotify playlists so you can listen on the go.

Thanks again for reading :) Let me know if you've any feature requests.

3346,The Music vs. The Show,"TLDR: I think it‚Äôs just as important (if not more) for EDM artists to put on a good show as it is for them to produce good tracks, something that‚Äôs largely unique to this genre. Share your thoughts in the comments. 

Something I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about lately is how EDM has so many artists that have great music but lackluster shows and vice versa. It seems like one of the only genres of music that the show is often times more important to staying relevant than people just regularly listening to the music. 

With hip-hop, for example, artists gain fans pretty much entirely from the tracks they pump out, and people come to their shows to see those tracks performed live. Popular artists like Post Malone and Lil Pump definitely don‚Äôt have the most exciting shows to see live, but this hasn‚Äôt hurt their relevancy at all, because people just wanted to hear their songs and they did. 

But with EDM, people seem to care less about specific tracks they‚Äôve heard by the artist and instead want to come to the show the artist puts together. Instead of just coming for individual tracks, people come to dance and see a light show and hear a Daft Punk song the artist threw into the their set. 

The result is that a lot of EDM artists can have massive success because of their ability to put on a good show even though their music isn‚Äôt widely listened to as much as artists from other genres, i.e. Odesza, Carnage, Hardwell. 

I‚Äôd even argue that the show is so important it‚Äôs managed to hurt EDM artists who focus more on their music than their show. Artists like Deadmau5 or Armin don‚Äôt have the same upbeat and wild shows as other EDM artists, and even though his music is higher quality and streamed more often they‚Äôve lost relevancy to artists that focus more on pumping up a crowd, ie dubstep, riddim, and trap artists. 

What do you guys think about all this? Is there any truth to do this and is EDM unique in this regard? Do you know of any EDM artists with great music and bad shows or vice versa? Let me know your thoughts. ",EDM,1541617650,TurquoiseFinch,2,1,True,2018-11-07

Here's the reply: 

EDM is changing.
&gt; 
&gt; - Artists have honestly gotten bored AF making 128bpm nonsense that all. sounds. the. same. If you had zero talent, the audience has gotten bored, and if you had lots of talent, you're seeking to express yourself in different directions and create a unique sound. That's why you see your favorite artists, who are still getting played, doing dramatically different stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; - Meanwhile - young people are moving on and aren't quite looking for the same stuff at festivals. Hip Hop and Latin have really gained momentum. So again, these very talented producers are chasing that talent.
&gt; 
&gt; - EDM was also a group of artists who developed that genre. The musical style is changing, but look at the artists that we associate with EDM: Avicii, Skrillex, Deadmau5, Martin Garrix, Zedd, Calvin Harris, David Guetta. In that order: Dead, Taking a Break, Tweeting instead of Producing, Still Rocking, Making Pop, Making Funky Tropical Chill Beats, and Fading into Obscurity.
&gt; 
&gt; - That's why... well, here are a few songs that illustrate how EDM is changing:
&gt; 
&gt; - Marshello - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tx1sqYc3qas - yes you all hate this guy, but whatever, you gotta remember that the market is among 14-18 year olds, not you washed up 20 year old oldies. But look! He's not partnering with Bebe Rexha, he's making music with Khaled. This is a good example of cross-pollination between EDM, pop and hip hop. Also note that male lyrics were a lot less common in 2012-2014 among EDM, and it's obviously noteworthy that the BPM is in the upper double digits until it hits double time at 2:30.
&gt; 
&gt; - CID - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcpeEb1z3Vw - remember, this is the guy who remixed Summertime Sadness in 2013 (and won a grammy for it), which even the Chainsmokers riffed on in their Selfie song (in 2015). So here he is pivoting to something that's... almost?... house feeling. But note that the lyrics, if you stripped away the backing track, would sound just about right in a smokey 1920s speakeasy. Can you imagine how electric it would have been to be in that studio?
&gt; 
&gt; - Diplo - who we all love - wen from THIS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFRyNEldHns to THIS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI0F70boFQ4. And yo, he also had a kid, and collaborated more, and his music continues to shine.

&amp;#x200B;

2. When these indie EDM labels sign artists, how is its different than with corporate labels?

3. Is it common to just sign tracks to a label for exposure but not actually be signed to that label?

4. How much of a cut do the labels get from these artists compared to other industries and compared to corporate labels?

&amp;#x200B;

5. I know there‚Äôs value in being independent in other genres like pop and hip hop because the corporate labels are shady and take away a lot of the cut of your music and own your intellectual property, but is there still a lot of value of not signing to a label (like Chance the Rapper), if most of the EDM labels are independent anyway?

I have always wanted to see him perform live, and the last time he came to my area I was out of town. This was back in like 2014 or 2015. I just found out that he will be coming to my area in November as part of the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball. I'm not interested in the other artists that will be there, but I will gladly sit through them so I can see Calvin Harris. My question is this- what are his performances like now? I just watched a video from 2014 that showed him at a Jingle Ball, and his show was only about 15 minutes long, but it was really good. Does he still play older stuff from 18 Months and Motion, or is it all Funk Wav Bounces and later? I don't hate his new stuff, but I prefer the older songs more. Even if he mixed old and new I wouldn't mind, so I just want to know if you think it would be worth it for me to go. Tickets are like $60 for the nosebleeds and that's all I really need, because I'll probably zone out watching the pop artists and I might even leave after Calvin Harris is done.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm gonna set up some ground rules that I think are pretty agreeable:

Keep it limited to EDM (Since EDM is a broad genre use your best judgement on what crosses over into non EDM genres)

Try to avoid repeat songs. If you think the song may be in the playlist already search for it. If it isn't, add it.

No spamming. Don't just add the entire discography of any artist.

Do not delete other tracks, unless they are repeats. Just because you think a track doesn't belong in here doesn't mean it should be deleted.

Now, I‚Äôm a broke bitch. So I‚Äôm gonna have to start saving and budgeting now for all this stuff. I probably could realistically only do one out of state festival so which should I do?

3531,"""Melodic Bass"" as billed, is not Melodic Bass","Seven Lions, if you really think about it, is trance music but arranged and produced in bass music fashion. ""strangers"", his best song by far (imo), what do you know, was a collab with trance stars myon &amp; shane 54 

Illenium is actually just emo pop music, arranged and produced in bass music fashion (leaning more towards future bass though..). 

if you think about it, thats basically exactly what creed and nickelback did (from a grunge / alternative fashion instead of bass) lol

In other words --- they are basically *bass remixes of trance songs and emo pop songs* (respectively) 

IMHO melodic bass music is led by Bassnectar, with basically no peers (although shoutout to Minnesota who is pretty dope too)

Timestretch, Empathy, Hologram, Into the Sun, etc etc

It is all unmistakeably bass music, but written from a melodic standpoint.

3537,Battle of 2 Boys Noize Albums: Oi Oi Oi (2007) vs Out of the Black (2012),"Considering this is an EDM subreddit, I assume many of you guys know who Boys Noize is and listen to his music. I first got into him after I found out that he was working with Lady Gaga on her sixth album. I had never heard of him before, and I absolutely loved *ARTPOP*, so I decided to check him out. I've fallen in love with his music‚ÄîI bought the whole *Out of the Black* album, and I plan on buying *Mayday* as well! I have also listened to his very first album, *Oi Oi Oi*. Since the BN subreddit almost never receives any action, I decided to post this thread here.

&amp;#x200B;

So I wanna ask you guys, for those who have listened to both of these albums, which do you prefer: *Oi Oi Oi*, or *Out of the Black*? The former is from 2007, the latter is from 2012. Five years is a big difference in the music world. I am aware that the former was his breakout album, and did a lot for his career. So I can see why people fell in love with his style. So in addition to a tracklist comparison of each album (both using the American iTunes tracklist with their respective bonus tracks), I want you guys to answer a series of questions between the two albums: **1)** Which one was more original for each album's respective time? **2)** Which one has aged better? \[OftB is 6 y/o, so compare how that album holds up now to how Ox3 held up back in 2013\] **3)** Which one was more profound upon first listen? **4)** Which one was more influential? **5)** Which one had more style? **6)** When they were released, which one stood out more among the competition? **7)** Between the two, which one do you guys think is more fun to dance to?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, here's my preference between the tracklists...

1. &amp; Down vs **What You Want**

2. Lava Lava vs **XTC**

3. The Battery vs **Missile**

4. **Oh!** vs Ich R U

5. Let's Buy Happiness vs **Rocky 2**

6. **Arcade Robot** vs Circus Full of Clowns

7. **Deny Selected** vs Conchord

8. Shine Shine vs Touch It

9. Vergifet vs **Reality** \[*NONE* of the rest of his discography will ever beat Reality!\]

10. Superfresh vs Merlin

11. Wu-Tang (The Battery Pt. 2) vs Stop

12. Don't Believe the Hype vs Got It

13. Frau vs Ich Jack

14. My Moon My Man (Boys Noize Remix) vs Distant Lover

&amp;#x200B;

Just to let you know, art is subjective and it's going to vary by individual. I don't want anyone answering if they haven't heard both albums in full and are unfamiliar with the songs. Meaning, you have to know which songs I'm talking about and you have to have listened to both of them in recent memory. Also, I have a feeling the album of preference for each user is going to give an idea of their age (when they started getting into the genre and going clubbing).

3624,I need help creating an EDM set for a party.,"Hello, i'm new into this sub and also english is not my first language, so sorry for any english mistakes.

I don't listen to EDM, and not much to electronic music in general. I'm mostly a weird/experimental guy in general who avoids sharing his music taste with others for fear of weirding them out. Yesterday i was at the college library, working on a song on my laptop (never realased anything, they are mostly for myself, if i need to describe them it would be dark ambient/noise/drone/field recording stuff).
So, this guy, who i share some classes with enters the library and after a few minutes comes to the chair next to mine and asks ""Hey, are you a DJ? You're using FL Studio!"". I said that i didn't consider myself a DJ but yes, i was working on a song. He asked to listen to it, i was reluctant but i gave my headphones to him, he listened to 10s of music and gave it back to me, with a funny look at his face. ""Huh, thats not my kind of music but its... nice."". I'm already used to it and just said thanks. 
In the next day, today, i was again in the library, but now studying, then out of nowhere, this guy with a very bro-ish vibe whom i had never spoken with comes to me and asks ""Hey, are you X from Y classes? I heard that you're a DJ. I doing a party next week and i need a DJ. I can pay you 200 bucks for it."".
I'm a broke college guy, so i ignored the fact that i'm not DJ and accepted the offer. So i have 9 days to create a DJ set. The problem is not really DJing (i have done this in my room for a few friends), but i know nothing about EDM or the current trends in music, if i were to play my original songs to this partys crowd they would certainly boo at me.
So i'm asking for help to create a ""friendly"" set that would appel to a more broad public. I would love recomendations of artists and songs for inspiration.

So i want to share this information because this i s the second time A/\I set git canceled in Taiwan this year.
Last time was at Looptopia in Apirl, it was announced super late like right an hour before their set.
The rumor said that Axwell had some visa issue due to his sub performance for Haedwell last year, someone shoud apply for his work permission but he didnt. Therefore Axwell's entry was denied.
When Ultra Taiwan announced AI I was so excited bc it means the rumor must be wrong i still had the chance to see A/\I in my home country.

But it seems impossible now, cause the visa issue cant fix within 5 yrs (say goodbye to the possible SHM set in Taiwan also) and the duo gonna take down after this year.

I‚Äôve been trying to find new music but no matter what station or sub-genre playlist I try to listen to it ends up being like 90% stuff I‚Äôm not into. I‚Äôve put together a playlist of my favorites. If I had to pick out a common theme myself I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a mix of really hype drops (Madeon - Grand Finale) and clever, evolving chord progressions (Eric Prydz - Generate). I think it could maybe be something like electrohouse? But I‚Äôm also not crazy about 4 on the floor beats. Used to be a big Krewella fan but Dubstep kinda got old.

If anybody feels like taking a look at this list of songs and identifying a specific sub-genre or theme that I could use to find new similar music, I‚Äôd appreciate it!

and which ones for Edm?  


Do you have more ideas about unlocking genders? its funny but I don't want chidren or elders getting scared if they listen to hardcore music, hehehe.

3681,Who is the biggest bum in EDM?,"Requirements: It must be a Mainstage act, someone who is consistently at festivals but who you feel has sets that have declined in quality year over year and is resting on their laurels.

&amp;#x200B;

My top 3:

1. DJ Snake (reasons below)
2. Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike
3. Alesso

Here's why DJ Snake gets my top spot. His sets lately have been an absolute disasters:

\* Continually **shrieking** into the mic  

\* Playing tired renditions of ""Turn Down For What"" from 2013  

\* Doing the ""everybody get the fuckin fuck down and lets fuckin jump together"" thing that no one seems to care about anymore  

\* Bringing J Ballsack on stage and trying to make Reggaeton popular at EDM festivals. No one asked for this, just please let it die

\* Stopping in the middle of his sets for 2 minutes to take a flag picture. Bro, you've been on the festival circuit forever, just get action shots mid-set or wait till it's over, good god.  

\* \[Going a century without any music playing in the middle of your set\](r/https://youtu.be/J2GmgOpkEI0?t=39m24s)  

\* \[4 entire minutes of ""A Different Way"" \*snoooooooze\*\](r/https://youtu.be/J2GmgOpkEI0?t=48m) If you listen closely you can actually hear the energy being sucked out of the crowd.  

\* Ending with the snooze fest anthem, ""Middle"". No remix, no mixing, no nothing.

3689,"The peculiar case of ""In my Mind"", now dominating the Charts","A song I haven't seen featured on this subreddit at all is Dynoro's ""In my mind"" and it's bloody brilliant! 

I heard it today on a German radiostation while on vacation and I was wondering why the fuck I haven't heard of this brilliant song, surely a song of this quality would reach /r/edm frontpage?

So I digged a bit deeper to find out that the release of this song had it's complication, which is why it went under the radar, until now! 

The Story: The song was originally released in January 2018 by Dynoro and simply called ""In My Mind"" (without any features), however the song doesn't just include elements from Ivan Goughs &amp; Feenixpawls In my Mind, but also has some of Gigi D'Agostinos ""L'amour toujours"" famous melody in it.

Now the problem with the first release in January 2018 despite it reaching the top 10 in Austrian and German Spotify charts was that Dynoro did not have the licenses to use the songs mentioned above. So in less than a month it was taken down.

In June 2018 it was re-released by the sony sub-label B1 Recordings, and Gigi D'Agostino is featuring on the song, despite not contributing to any of the production (I guess it was a measurement for the licensing).

Needless to say, the song climbed up the charts extremely fast and now sits as leader of the German and Austrian Single charts, while slowly climbing the UK and Italian charts.
Ironically, it's Gigi D'Agostinos first Single that is topping the German charts, despite him not contributing to it at all.

Overall a very peculiar case, but it shouldn't distract from how amazing this song is! I was absolutely impressed hearing this song on the Radio, as opposed to the usual crap topping the charts, this is mindblowing!",EDM,1534978758,ManUtd1995,22,41,True,2018-08-22

https://www.facebook.com/groups/ShambhalaMusicFestivalBC/permalink/10156182011488110/?comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22O%22%7D

I think it's interesting that Rezz commented, I think musicians in general it can be a tough go especially when critics come out. For her the quick rise to popularity it may be a bit harder to take having a bunch of people suddenly not feeling your stuff.

I like some of her music, think it sounds good on good sound system etc, but think her DJing is nonexistent (so no she doesn't ""slay"" live like people say), her production seems to be repetitive, and her fan base is so spun up into this weird cultish frenzy I think it makes probably just makes her an easier target (they act like Bieber/Gomez fans on Twitter.)

Just wondering if other have any thought on Rezz being overrated and/or this little bit of drama going on.

3752,Showerthought: How would you react if someone like Virtual Self came out in a year and said nothing he has released was his own...,"...but it was intentional!  

Let's face it; most people enjoying VS's style of shows probably weren't exploring that style of music before he showed it to them. We as fans tend to go where we are lead in our respective sub-genres (if you know what I mean?)

So what if someone like Porter was enjoying some (I hate giving genres names because people yell at you so we'll just call the genre apples); anyways Porter liked apples for the longest time. Thought to himself; damn I bet my fans would like apples too, but very few people would listen to me if I just recommend apples. They might try one or two, but not become fans of it.  *""But what if I started selling apples?!?""* said Porter...

Alas, Virtual Self was created. A place where Porter can use his popular name and apple tossing skills (DJ'ing) to help promote the apples created by the best apple growers to ever exist. Roughly a year after apples have become a staple in our musical diet then Porter will break the news to us that he's just been using Virtual Self as a facade to promote the little apples growers that none of us knew about. (Lets assume he's been profit sharing, doing some collabs, etc. been real nice about the thing.)

How would you feel about it? Obviously this could apply to other DJs who have an alias; or hell it could even just be a normal thing.

Idk; I've just always felt like it's kinda hard for people to break through in the production world so some people might do this to help out? I'm high please don't judge me",EDM,1533761196,MarcusMan6,2,1,True,2018-08-08

3759,My Wedding Playlist for EDM,"Just wanted to share a playlist I made for my wedding we recently had. We had a pretty mixed crowd and it can be troublesome to find a good DJ that knows EDM music that can fit a crowd of younger and older generations. 

*Downtempo/chill music for the cocktail and dinner hours.

*For the dance music I decided to give the DJ more freedom not sure what she played actually.

Late-night phase II of the dancing was all my music. Lots of Timmy Trumpet bounce type stuff here.


Generally was looking for lighter electronic music with vocals and acoustic or instrumental elements to it and as the night went on moved to more heavier stuff like chill step and whatnot.  My goal was to kind of trick the older people into enjoying some EDM without realizing it's EDM. Anyway have a gander. Hopefully someone who is planning a wedding can get some ideas from this and remove some of the stress. If anyone has any questions feel free.

I have bittersweet feelings about the mysterious nature of this artist though. One part of me loves how anonymous they are; the mystery draws me in. But the other part hates it, because I have no idea how to find out if they've worked on anything else.

But whoever they are, they seem to be radio silent right now. I know it's barely been a year since II came out, but I'm still craving more.

Does anyone know of any artists with a similar sound? I love the heavy metal and D&amp;B influences and the dark, crunchy sound.

3863,A month ago i never wanted to make music again. This week i dropped my best song ever.,"Being in the military it‚Äôs beyond hard to balance the schedule of full time work and going home to continue music and balance a social life, and I‚Äôd done it for years before I‚Äôd finally hit a breaking point and didn‚Äôt want to continue at all with music.  Took some time off and hit a pretty rough patch and music was there to bring me back up again. I got so caught up with ‚Äúwanting to make it‚Äù i forgot why i fell in love with producing in the first place. These last few weeks of relying on music to help me through it, i ended up making my best song to date. I had so much fun making this that it completely made me feel like i was just starting again, and i hope that you guys enjoy it as much as i do.  Here‚Äôs the link!

When artists say like Eric Prydz &amp; Deadmau5 play a live event, what's the purpose of them being there?  From my noob perspective, it appears as if you can have the entire light show in the arena, all the fans, the entire 9 yards - but why can't an iPod just be plugged into the PA &amp; someone press play?  Like when I watch Deadmau5 play Ghosts n Stuff or Eric Prydz play Generate - what are they actually doing on stage?

From then to now, there doesn't seem to be any variety in their music anymore, it's basically recyling the same formula with the same rhythms, sounds, etc over and over again. For example, Tiesto tracks doesn't sound like Tiesto produced it at all and runs the alias as more of business than anything. His collab w/ Jauz sounded like Jauz produced the entire thing and just used the Tiesto name to get more exposure. I like some of Hardwell's music, but in the future, he can't stick to the his niche forever and will inevitably get tired of what he's doing now. There's a guy called 4B and his remixes sounded like he just looked at the original project, put the same drum kick pattern, cut up a few clips and put some effects on them, and finished it within 4 hours (i'm probably exaggerating now because idk anything about producing). There's also Caked Up which seem like they don't know how to use a synth.

I'm looking for more House with punch and energy.  I've got a good amount already but I didn't do a super good job keeping my crates organized when I first started DJing so it's mixed in with a lot of crap and I'd rather just find new stuff for Saturday.  I tried Beatport's most recent top 100 but honestly most of the songs I listened to tonight from there sound like shit to me, and certainly don't have energy.  Plus I'd rather not play what everyone else is playing anyways.

At first I thought it was prog house but most of my progressive house isn't nearly as banging as that.  Complextra maybe?

Never marching only one year. I love the Roli Seaboard rise. I love EDM.

3926,Real trance (once again),"Perhaps a strong statement to brand something as ""real"" but I have not heard any authentic trance music since 1994. 

In order to understand each other I thought I would define trance as that genre of contemporary electronic dance music that puts you in a trance (i.e. it has all the characteristics of primitive dance rhythms but recreates them electronically with repetitive beats and soundscapes). 

When trance emerged in Germany around 1991 as a new sub-genre it was just that but then clever people decided to add happy melodies and arpeggios and therefore make it palatable to the masses (no names mentioned, you know who they are). 
Back then a UK based group called System 7 were releasing gems which occasionally were bordering on ambient or ambient trance (anyone who recalls the legendary Trance Europe Express compilation series would not know what I mean).

I was glad to see them releasing a new album this month called Cafe Seven. Here is the link http://www.a-wave.com/system7/ to their primitive website. Their album is also released on Spotify.

If you are looking for something more hypnotic to take you deeper I would highly recommend this (and yes there are also ambient house or ambient tracks there, fear not).",EDM,1529488081,Aias23,0,0,True,2018-06-20

3954,Riot Ten is a fraud,"This past weekend I saw bommer b2b he$h, blunts &amp; blondes, eh!de, and riot ten play a show in my local city. Been waiting on this show for a while. 

All the openers were dope as fuck. 

But then we get to riot ten. It took me a little but to figure it out, but we started to notice that something seemed off. Everytime I looked at the stage Riot Ten didn't even seem to be touching the decks in front of him. Maybe once or twice to adjust a knob but that's it. Even when 3 or 4 songs would all overlap and start and stop he would never even touch the decks just pretend to use one of the filters. 

And get this- he never put his headphones on once the whole set. I'm pretty familiar with mixing and I know that almost ALL djs need headphones to throw down a good set with no errors. Somehow the songs would transition magically without even a touch to the decks and then he would put his hands up to dance after a crazy drop swap that he didn't do shit to do. 

Everyone in the crowd was too lit so nobody else noticed but we noticed. Don't think that trying to distract us with the party atmosphere worked. 

Riot Ten you are a fraud. You played a prerecorded set and I hope more people start to realize you're a piece. Your music isn't even that good and now I think it's definitely ghost produced as well.

They had their opener Elohim come up and sing her vocals live for a song they collaborated on. Had a sort of DJ battle to We Can Make The World Stop. They were dripping in sweat and winded by the end of it. It was honestly a beautiful set and they got a thunderous applause when they finished.

It is edm, I think it came out between 2013 and 2016. No words. Most importantly, it has a very fun accordion like part in the middle of the song that gets very loud and makes you wanna shake your hips. The beginning of the song starts with a very consistent beat quiet then getting louder and the end is the same consistent beat, eventually fading off. Song is perhaps 2 to 3 min long... 


Also important, I really don't think it's Edward Maya. I obsessed with his tracks when stereo love came out and it wasn't something that sounds like his music (but who knows!!!!).

I got a question about Robin Schulz and how he got picked by/got noticed. I know he made his big debut back in 2013 by remixing the song Waves from Mr.Probz. My question is based around this song and how he got the vocals.
1)Did he just stumble on the track and just remixed it and send it to a label? 2)Or did he stumble on it, remixed it and send it to Mr.Probz? 3)Or did Probz contact Robin to remix the track?
I'm looking for vocals myself and I'm interested how it works when you aren't a big producer or popular within the scene. I can't find any info around this topic, I know he's been producing since 2007 so maybe he made some connections along the way?

Randomly contacting instagram artists? Looking into some secret ghost community?

Also, how to approach so you don't get ripped of? How do I approximate the value of my track? Which rights to give - I see there are publishing vs. Masters rights? Where to find some contract template or how to build one my own?

What I've found for now is one page that actually sells quite often (atleast as they say): https://www.edmghostproducer.com/be-a-ghost/ How efficient are these pages - do they do good business for you?

At last, my main social media is Instagram where I have my audience and producer identity. Is it adviceable to publicly reveal that you offer your services? Does that somehow lower your bar down, making you target of low-life artists who would just annoy you?

Couple months ago he released snap chats lowkey previewing all the songs and he only released 2 (maybe 3 I forget) songs prior to the album. What I love is he stay consistent through the whole album, all his tracks were similar in some ways but different. Where I think artists go wrong with albums is they try to do too much and but too many genres are EDM in them. Ookay also stayed with his sound and what he knew worked where other artists (Chainsmokers, Don Diablo, Alison Wonderland) abounded their sounds and went for a hail marry which in my option failed. It‚Äôs been a awhile since I‚Äôve been hype for an EDM album and been able to to listen to it consistently because of how good it is.

EDM for me has been, from the beginning, the freedom to create whatever sound the producer wants to create,  how unpopular it may be. It makes me so goddamn sad and angry that people cannot accept that not everybody likes the style they like, that producers always advance, grow up and also change their personal taste and do not always stay with the same sound. Please stop visiting music videos or channels you don't like  (anymore) or that annoy you, instead of telling the guys putting so much effort into it that what they do is sh*t. PLEASE stop that, I don't want to miss awesome productions, just because there are people who can't stand it that life is always changing!

4175,EDM Sub-Genre - Noob Question,"Hello All,

I have been loved EDM for a few years now but just found songs I randomly liked. Never really knew about all the sub-genre's of EDM. I recently bought tickets to Paradiso and this has created a curiosity in me. Listening to a few of the artists, it doesn't match exactly what I like.. Which comes to the question of, what do I like? 

Seems like most of the artists are a little too ""dubby"" for me.. I like the EDM songs that have lyrics and stuff in them, not just beat. Most of the songs do have a drop though. Looking around it seems maybe I like house music? Just thought I'd get a little help on this... I'll post a listing of a few songs I like. It would help me a lot to know what sub-genre I like so I can know which artists I would enjoy at Paradiso. Like DeadMau5, not a big fan because it seems to just be beat. My favorite artists atm are probably R3hab, Borgeous, and Marshmello.

A few examples of songs I like:

It starts off slow and a female vocal starting around 20-30 seconds into the song. Might be a duet love song. I hope this is enough info been wanting to listen to it again.

How much I love the music from the 2012-era, I don't think that it will succeed just by copying those sounds. It needs something fresh. Music needs innovation to keep fresh, just like how Trance is innovating itself all the time and other genres aswell. 

What kind of direction you think Progressive House needs to go in to make it mainstream again? Future Progressive House? Maybe some Bass House sounds? A combination with techno? Even more pop sounded than it did a few years back (I really hope not)?

With a lot of big EDM artists (Afrojack, Hardwell, Nicky Romero etc) reacting positively on the SHM reunion and feeling inspired by Progressive more and more again, I really think this subgenre can come back but not just by remaking the 2012 sound.

4221,Best combination for a music video is a cross between cringey with modern quality.

(When I was 6-10) and I have found out that the best way of making a really memorable and eye-catching music video is to use these formulas in the editing and filming process.

I often parody it a lot in my own music videos.



1. Make the video‚Äôs idea EXTREMELY clever.

2. Make the video extremely high quality for the time.

3. Make the editing and plot kind of unpredictable and being slightly choppy is okay in these scenarios.

4. Make the outcome not too clich√© but kind of clich√© and silly.

5. Make the video kind of have some minor cheesy phrases and lines for some characters.

6. Make the video have ALOT of adult humor. Adult humor is the most important role in music videos like this kind. You simply cannot make something good without the adult and sexual double meanings.

7.  Make the video have a lot of cliche‚Äôd characters. I know this mays kind very dire of course since nobody usually likes cliche‚Äôd characters, but it‚Äôs essential to the video‚Äôs theme, and make the personalities of the cliche‚Äôd characters very exaggerated.

8. Make it very cinematic.

KSHMR (not so much the ethnic exotic sounding albums, but the more straight SuperSaw housey ones)

Basically i like house that has a big synthy build-up, and then a drop, with a really powerful, tinny, brassy, percussive saw lead melody on the drop, but the saw usually is in the lower octaves, and not high pitched, and basically just a kick with a slow attack sub layered in quarter notes, then maybe the next 8 bars adds in a hi hat or something, it's really that characteristic sound of the drop that I'm locked into, the intros and breaks can vary wildly.

Is this big room? or future house? progressive? Deep?

I just can't figure it out, i wish spotify would tell me the supposed genre of a song i listen to.

Here's a list of songs for exapmle

**Deeper - KSHMR - this one has such an amazing drop oh my god, i lose my mind, if anything, assume this song is the premise of the question; what genre is this song!!??**

**Astronomia - Tony Igy - This along with deeper is like my favorite song, i realize it might be slightly different style, but what genre is this?**

D# fat - armin van buren

greyhound - swedish house mafia

Tremor - DMLV

Tutankhamun - Borgeous

I was just watching a video where Guetta gives advice for new DJs (just randomly popped up on my feed). And the comments were so fucking toxic towards him as a producer and DJ. Among the standard EDM-hating crap we're all used to, people were calling him a nobody, a druggie and a crap producer.

The guy helped pioneer modern dance music and I know plenty of people who got into EDM because of David Guetta. Despite not liking most of his music these days, I have a massive amount of respect for him, and I think some people should have more respect for him.

TLDR: David Guetta gets too much hate considering how he's helped dance music dramatically over the years.",EDM,1521084804,SlowLawfulness,74,150,True,2018-03-14
4315,Brooks AMA - Friday 3/9 12PM est (6PM cet),"Pioneering his own blend of electronic dance music over the past two years, Dutch producer Brooks has carved a solid name for himself with a selection of outstanding originals and remixes which have caught the world‚Äôs attention. Brooks has managed to stand out from the masses and gain increasing recognition with his innovative style of rhythmic electro house and melodic future house.

Alongside his clear production talent, Brooks‚Äô ability to showcase a stellar performance on-stage has earned him a reputation as one of electronic music‚Äôs most heterogenous DJ‚Äôs. From Europe to Asia, Africa and beyond, the producer is maintaining a lasting impression on a global scale. Having performed at World Club Dome and Ushuaia Ibiza and with plenty more on his plate for 2018, expect to see Brooks showcasing more of his eclectic form of dance music with wide-reaching appeal.

With artists like Martin Garrix championing Brooks as one of their favourite DJ‚Äôs for the coming months and beyond, it‚Äôs evident that this is one young producer who is destined to make a prominent mark on the electronic dance music scene.",EDM,1520421450,KingNickyThe1st,2,52,True,2018-03-07

4335,"Before you taking a jab at the artist, please consider a few things..","So recently artists like Alesso has been put into hot water and it's almost like all of a sudden he's making a heel turn. Fans are real quick to rain in jabs and criticisms. As a long time fan of his who does not enjoy the recent stuff that he puts out, here are my 2 cents for everyone to think about:

1. As fans we are allowed to listen to whatever genres we like at the moment and we often would take breaks from listening to the same genre. I'm no artist but i would guess they are the same and need certain space to relax for their creative juice to be flowing freely, otherwise it would become like work where they have to stick to 1 formula and just keep grinding on it.

2. Artists are human beings and they are sensitive, and criticism weighs much deeper/longer than compliments, artists may read on stuff and are not good at filtering them out wisely at all. Seeing comments like ""sellout/ washup/ please go die"" etc., Imagine if you were him, would you be like ""alright let me force myself to switch back to prog. house to please them again"" or ""screw it watever, you guys don't deserve me"". I would imagine stuff like this really drains an artist even more and this could be the reason why he's not having as much fun on stage. 

3. Do we really wanna see these super-talented artists who just step out of the scene like Avicci when they can't handle the pressure from performing and fans' criticism? Do you not appreciate all the golden tunes that he has brought to us throughout the years?

4. For all the sell out/money talks, the guy is making a living for himself, on the other hand, a lot of party goers attend his shows just to have fun and get high or all other reasons. Do you really think you love and care for his music more than he does? What so much about us that allow us to call ppl out for their career choices? If you really don't enjoy his stuff anymore, the best to do is just stop going to his show, skipping his sets, stop streaming his music and pretending he doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. Spreading negativity with only your side of opinions really wouldn‚Äôt help anything in general, afterall we all love EDM and this community and music should only serve 1 purpose, which is for us to enjoy.

Edit: adding a point. I believe artists were born from passions, and passions could be fueled by  their inspirations at that very moment. In an old interview, Alesso stated that his productions were very much based on his personal stories and those emotions/energy in those tracks were heart-penetrating. As time passes and after these very young artists have toured around the world and meet with different people, their old perspectives/experiences are probably gonna be replaced by some new ones, could it be other genres, a city, a new personal story or even a girl. They might not be able to produce the same way based on the original inspirations they had years ago. By then if fans can't no longer connect with this music anymore, it would be better for both to just move on.   ",EDM,1520476007,newbiesean,25,46,True,2018-03-07

From Trance to Trap I love and listen to all aspects of it. I listen mostly to house and trance but I still love to enjoy a lot of the other sub genre out there. 

Here is my question: What song is unquestionably number #1 on your track list? 
  
These were some of the songs I narrowed it down to in my opinion. I‚Äôm a massive Above and Beyond fan so I maybe a little bias.

Above and Beyond - You gotta Go
Above and Beyond - Alchemy
Porter Robinson- Language 
Avicii- Level
Edward Maya - Stereo Love
Cosmic Gate- Be your sound
Tiesto- Adagio for Strings
Kaskade - Eyes 
Madeon and Porter Robinson - Shelter
Audien - Wayfarer 

From here I really thought about which of one these songs evoked the most emotions for me and I came to a conclusion it‚Äôs hands down Language by Porter. That‚Äôs my #1 song. 

I would love to hear from you guys out there about your favorite songs. Maybe I‚Äôll come across some new music during this process. Thanks!

4375,Dancehall - the new mainstream EDM trend? It seems so:,"I regularly browse tons of new music and am very interested in industry observing how this EDM Trend Machine is functioning, what I recently noticed is a big increase in ***Dancehall EDM***. I think this term sounds for itself, these tracks are more or less EDM, but they're technically on a dancehall beat.

I'm not the biggest fan of it tbh, especially since it's inspired by the genre outside EDM/more assiociated with pop music. I'm open for just good music though, I think new Dillon Francis track is pretty allright, but the other music I listed here is a total meh for me.

Only in a last few days:

[Guetta released a collab with Sean Paul]
(https://open.spotify.com/track/3soOPBuMK8YMdWnV7xpEyf?si=kfRJVV_wTdKxQ0Ue8GLDJA)

[Vinai &amp; Redfoo on Spinnin' Records](https://open.spotify.com/track/3bBlpCVVbSRDTeqwtxnewp?si=wkYB-QfPTXuSerXgS3dEgQ)

[New Grandtheft track on Dim Mak Records](https://open.spotify.com/track/3NvgrytANWH53cZ1yqpZcP?si=7-CQ9FT4Tv2x9il7Zwz7WA)

Another Dancehall Spinnin release, [culpriit - Closer Still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2fbOhosadY)

And today, [new Dillon Francis single](https://open.spotify.com/track/3dXWDwSl1Kooi0gPFizIud?si=M_l6BleEQvO-mT_Ah_5DPg)

They are all quite big names/labels so it's a big sign it may become (or already is) a new trend in EDM.

Other notable releases during last months:

[Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike &amp; Quintino - Slow Down](https://open.spotify.com/track/6oU6OTnU945Dz59dCa45Gq?si=E69gzaT7RB2NuhthMWiFHg)

[Dillon Francis - Hello There](https://open.spotify.com/track/7fyx7nBQTEtYrfXc0UgUYs?si=lQxrZmyAT_uBAC1iWWKjSA)

[Trobi &amp; Boaz van de Beatz feat. √Çd√Øka &amp; KaliBwoy - U Don't Know [SPINNIN'] ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C3NqfIq7Uc)

[Afro Bros - Bootybeat EP [SPINNIN']](https://open.spotify.com/album/73JVwaMLt38nk2iX6kAHzi?si=cdLG5kEWQXqnfOrjc4jf9A)

[Kris Kross Amsterdam - Gone Is The Night [SPINNIN'] ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8ng07VhTnE)

[Cashmere Cat, Major Lazer, Tory Lanez - Miss You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h0bkuWzQeU)

Oh, and how could I forget [DJ Snake ft. Lauv - A Different Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuCq8mtK8J4)

Altough Major Lazer were, of course, always making this kind of music ([Watch Out For This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zCoCa6b6cU), [Come On To Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z9t0VkxPCY)), but back then they were pretty much the only ones (and they didn't used to be bad in it imo). Now it seems like other artists who were never assiociated with dancehall are jumping on this trend.

In my opinion in the mainstream we will see an increase of dancehall and taking the Poppy Future Bass' place instead, since it's been too long for it staying relevant, I predict Future Bass to return to its experimental, non-commercial side, like it was in 2013-2015.

But what do you think? Is it going to become next big thing in the mainstream? Do you like it, and why actually not haha? And let me know if there are other notable releases I forgot to mention.

I made a friend of mine a disc of some of my favorite basic Electronic music in an attempt to fully utilize the speakers in her car, which have really nice bass and low mids, but I am not really familiar with a large body of works under the umbrella of electronic (my home genre is metal), and I wanted some suggestions for a version 2. I asked her to go down the list and mark which ones she did and didn't like, so that I could make a decent revision. And before anyone asks, her stereo does not have an Auxiliary port, usb port, or bluetooth, so no longer mediums than an 80 minute compact disc.  

The Good:  
Awolnation - Sail (Original Mix)  
Skrillex - Bangarang  
Skrillex - Scary monsters and Nice Sprites  
Gemini - Blue (a strong 3rd favorite)  
Gemini - No Way Out  
Imatem - Conquer  
Avicii - Levels  
Phaeleh - Afterglow (her absolute favorite)  
Major Lazer - Lean On  
Beats Antique - I Got (a close second)  

This all comes in at 38 of 80 minutes. The bad are songs that were a part of V1, but removed via feedback from her.  

The Bad:  
Skrillex - Kyoto  
Gemini - To The World  
Gemini - Feel Stronger  
Deadmau5 - Ghosts 'n Stuff (she couldn't stand Rob Swire's voice)  
Beats Antique - Extra Extra  
Phantogram - You don't get me high anymore  
Justice - D.A.N.C.E.  
Daft Punk - Prime Time of Your Life  
Kernkraft 400 - Zombie Nation  
Headhunterz - The Lost Soul (Least Favorite, ""too repetitive"")  

Based on your collective knowledge of different genre's and artists I've likely never experienced, what can you recommend to me to add to the original 10 she liked off the disc to replace what she didn't? As I said before, my personal experience in this genre is lacking, but I want to make something she enjoys from start to finish, so throw anything that makes sense with this my way and I'll listen to it with open ears! I see she liked some of the slower bass heavy songs, but I'm having trouble placing what she enjoys in a hard hitting song. Any suggestions for listening would be appreciated. Thanks!

#10 Bass Producers to Watch in 2018

#####[Robotaki](https://soundcloud.com/robotaki/tracks)
Canadian future bass producer Robotaki has been on a roll since the start of 2017. As a consistent supporting act on Porter Robinson &amp; Madeon‚Äôs Shelter Tour, Robotaki has clearly taken advantage of this experience to polish and refine his technical production skills, mastering crisp future bass supersaws in particular. At the close of the Shelter Tour, Robotaki released an [official remix](https://soundcloud.com/robotaki/shelter) for the track. Robotaki has incorporated some pop elements into his productions, with his singles, most notably [‚ÄúDrunk feat. Reece,‚Äù](https://soundcloud.com/robotaki/drunk) featuring impeccable  production, melody, and fantastic sound design. With an upcoming EP announced, Robotaki will be a name to watch for fans of vocal-laden future bass. **Recommended tracks:** [Robotaki ‚Äì Together We‚Äôre Screwed ft. Nevve](https://soundcloud.com/robotaki/together-were-screwed), [Robotaki ‚Äì Restless](https://soundcloud.com/robotaki/restless), [Robotaki ‚Äì Monkey Bars ft. Claire Ridgeley]( https://soundcloud.com/robotaki/monkey-bars-feat-claire-ridgely)

#####[JUDGE](https://soundcloud.com/judgebeats)
JUDGE is a young producer who made a name for himself with smooth remixing of popular hip hop and r&amp;b tracks on SoundCloud. Some of his notable work includes his remix of [THEY. ‚Äì U RITE](https://soundcloud.com/judgebeats/u-rite-judge-remix) and his [collaboration with fellow rising producer Whipped Cream](https://soundcloud.com/judgebeats/unforgettable-judge-x-whipped-cream-remix), a remix of French Montana‚Äôs summer anthem ‚ÄúUnforgettable.‚Äù This remixes feature contagious and groovy basslines making them perfect for club play. After impressing producers around the bass scene, JUDGE released his first EP, [‚ÄúX,‚Äù](https://soundcloud.com/judgebeats/sets/judge-x) featuring collaborations with Wax Motif, X&amp;G, Alexander Lewis, and Graves, among others. With co-production credit on Marshmello &amp; Migos‚Äô track ‚ÄúDanger,‚Äù look for JUDGE‚Äôs productions to be deservedly hyped this year. **Recommended Tracks:** [JUDGE x ALEXANDER LEWIS ‚Äì BRIGHT](https://soundcloud.com/judgebeats/judge-x-alexander-lewis), [JUDGE X GRAVES ‚Äì RUSH](https://soundcloud.com/judgebeats/judge-x-graves-rush-1), [JUDGE ‚Äì PROMISE ft. Lil West](https://soundcloud.com/judgebeats/promise-ft-lil-west)

#####[UNKWN](https://soundcloud.com/itsunkwn)
Trap producer UNKWN had an extremely successful 2017, releasing both original productions and acclaimed remixes. While UNKWN has yet to truly come into his own singular style, his releases thus far, while dynamic, have been impressive and well-executed. He has employed a staccato, percussive style of drop in tracks such as his [remix of TroyBoi &amp; Ekali ‚Äì Truth](https://soundcloud.com/officialtrapparty/troyboi-x-ekali-truth-unkwn-remix), while opting for horns and a Quix-style synth on his [collaborative remix with Kayoh of Fabian Mazur‚Äôs track ‚ÄúMake It Bounce.‚Äù](https://soundcloud.com/trapcords/makeitbounce) His hot productions even caught the attention of renowned minimalist trap producer UZ, who tapped UNKWN to [remix his track with ATLiens, ‚ÄúCaverns,‚Äù]( https://soundcloud.com/qualitygoodsrecs/uz-atliens-cavern-unkwn-remix) becoming perhaps UNKWN‚Äôs most well-known and respected remix to date. UNKWN is poised to have a great 2018. **Recommended tracks:** [Fabian Mazur &amp; UNKWN ‚Äì Firestarter](https://soundcloud.com/lowlypalace/fabian-mazur-unkwn-firestarter) , [UZ &amp; Stooki Sound ‚Äì Bang feat. Foreign Beggars &amp; Onoe Caponoe (UNKWN Remix)](https://soundcloud.com/qualitygoodsrecs/uz-stooki-sound-bang-feat-foreign-beggars-onoe-caponoe-unkwn-remix)

#####[Montell2099](https://soundcloud.com/montell2099)
Auckland producer Montell2099 broke out in 2017 releasing several noteworthy originals and remixes, especially with his insane pots-and-pans percussion trap track [‚ÄúSUSU‚Äù](https://soundcloud.com/montell2099/susu-2) intro on RL Grime‚Äôs Halloween VI mix. Montell2099‚Äôs productions often feature gorgeous synth stabs and arpeggiation. He released an official remix of Lorde‚Äôs track [‚ÄúGreen Light,‚Äù](https://soundcloud.com/montell2099/lorde-green-light-montell2099-sachi-remix-1) partnering with Red Bull Studios for the piece. Montell2099 also collabed with popular rapper 21 Savage to release [Hunnid on the Drop](https://soundcloud.com/redbullsoundselect/montell2099-x-21-savage-hunnid-on-the-drop). I look forward to his unique productions catching the attention of bigger collaborators, as we will hopefully see more great music from Montell2099 released in 2018. **Recommended tracks:** [montell2099 ‚Äì raindrop2099](https://soundcloud.com/montell2099/raindrop2099-1), [montell2099 ‚Äì space](https://soundcloud.com/montell2099/space), [montell2099 ‚Äì possible](https://soundcloud.com/montell2099/possible)

#####[Ramzoid](https://soundcloud.com/ramzoid)
Canadian producer Ramzoid made an impressive impact on the bass music scene in 2017. His crisp tracks employ strong melody and technical production skills, and his creativity is self-evident. While most of Ramzoid‚Äôs productions have employed elements of future bass and melodic and future trap, he has not shied away from tackling heavier sound design, exemplified in his [remix of trap classic kaaris ‚Äì charge](https://soundcloud.com/ramzoid/kaaris-charge-ramzoid-edit-1). Last year, Ramzoid released an original track, [‚ÄúUnderwater,‚Äù](https://soundcloud.com/bitbirdofficial/ramzoid-underwater) on San Holo‚Äôs bitbird label, and even collaborated with jazzy heavyweight producer Gramatik to remix Flume‚Äôs track [‚ÄúWall Fuck.‚Äù](https://soundcloud.com/gramatik/flume-wall-fuck-gramatik-ramzoid-remix). 2018 looks to be Ramzoid‚Äôs chance to break out as an innovative and respected producer. **Recommended tracks:** [N.E.R.D ‚Äì Lemon (Ramzoid Remix)](https://soundcloud.com/ramzoid/nerd-lemon-ramzoid-remix), [Jai Wolf ‚Äì Like It‚Äôs Over (Ramzoid Remix)](https://soundcloud.com/jaiwolfmusic/like-its-over-ramzoid-remix-1), [Ramzoid ‚Äì BCW](https://soundcloud.com/ramzoid/bcw-1), [Post Malone ‚Äì Congratulations (Ramzoid Remix)](https://soundcloud.com/ramzoid/congratulations-ramzoid-edit)

#####[Hekler](https://soundcloud.com/heklermusic)

Having [remixed Denzel Curry‚Äôs hip hop track ‚ÄúUltimate,‚Äù](https://soundcloud.com/heklermusic/ultimate) [released on Borgore‚Äôs Fresh Blood label](https://soundcloud.com/frshblood/hekler-megalink), and [collaborated with TWONK producer Hydraulix](https://soundcloud.com/hydraulix-dub/getbuck), Hekler is set to explode into 2018 with some innovative hybrid bangers. **Recommended tracks:** [HEKLER ULTIMATE VIP](https://soundcloud.com/heklermusic/hekler-ultimate-vip), [HEKLER &amp; G-REX ‚Äì ATONEMENT](https://soundcloud.com/heklermusic/atonement)

#####[DELAY.](https://soundcloud.com/delayproductions)

Fusing east-Asian and southern hip-hop trap sounds together seamlessly, DELAY. has carved out a unique sound niche in an attempt to depict [his own personal background](https://imgur.com/a/n2M9B). DELAY.‚Äôs 2017 album ‚ÄúBetween 2 Worlds‚Äù takes listeners on an imaginative journey with strong cohesion and vision. His singles, such as [‚ÄúShenzou 5‚Äù](https://soundcloud.com/delayproductions/shenzhou-5), have expanded on this sound universe that started in 2016 with the release of his [808‚Äôs From Asia EP](https://soundcloud.com/delayproductions/sets/808s-from-asia).

LA producer Hex Cougar has been making quality future bass tracks for the last few years. With several features on Benzi‚Äôs famed Girl Trapz series, Hex Cougar has gained widespread recognition from djs in the bass scene for his light and energetic productions. His [remix/mashup](https://soundcloud.com/hex-cougar-hextras/anythinguwant) of Tove Lo ‚Äì Talking Body with Ginuwine ‚Äì Pony received notable support, as did his [remix of Bando Jonez ‚Äì Sex You](https://soundcloud.com/hex-cougar-hextras/sex-u). In 2017, Hex Cougar collabed with acclaimed producer graves on [‚ÄúLet Me Go‚Äù]( https://soundcloud.com/wearegraves/let-me-go-feat-lil-traffic-aviella-hex-cougar) from his Hilo EP, and also released a widely played original track, [Agatha](https://soundcloud.com/hex-cougar-hextras/hex-cougar-agatha).

#####[Dabow](https://soundcloud.com/da-bow)
Argentinian trap producer Dabow has been making innovative beats for several years. Pairing sharp saw synths with powerful with rhythmic 808-laden basslines and the occasional pitched-up vocal sample, Dabow‚Äôs trap bangers are infectious, and immediately impress upon the listener his tremendous skill in sound design. He has [collaborated with star New Zealand producer Quix](https://soundcloud.com/buygore/likethat), participated in [KRANE‚Äôs respected Sessions project]( https://soundcloud.com/kranesessions/krne-x-dabow-stomp-sessions_21), and released one of the hottest trap tracks of 2017 with his original track [‚ÄúOle.‚Äù](https://soundcloud.com/da-bow/ole-original-mix). Dabow has started out 2018 strong already with a couple of great productions, and look for him to maintain that momentum through the year. **Recommended tracks:** [Dabow &amp; Juelz ‚Äì Flashbang](https://soundcloud.com/da-bow/dabow-juelz-flashbang-1), [Boombox Cartel ‚Äì Widdit ft.

Part of the up-and-coming [Lost Dogz](https://soundcloud.com/lostdogz) crew, Untitld consistently produces imaginative, percussive trap beats. Untitld‚Äôs signature metallic bell and hollow block synths and heavy basslines are cornerstones of his experimental compositions.

4475,Porter Robinson Eye-Opening Letter On The State Of EDM,"[Link to original article](http://www.youredm.com/2018/01/24/promotional-message-porter-robinson-uncovered-explaining-views-electronic-music/)

Virtual Self is my new side-project. With this E.P., I want to convey a certain kind of ‚Äònew nostalgia‚Äô and resuscitate some things that have fallen out of fashion, especially from the early 2000s.

Musically, the project is super super inspired by rhythm games and electronic music from that time period. I could talk endlessly about the techniques that I learned to make stuff sound like it was written in 2001, but that‚Äôs probably boring to you ‚Äî but I tried to authentically incorporate IDM-y, jungly drum breaks, era-accurate trancy supersaw sections, early hardcore and j-core elements, but all morphed into something that sounds kind of ‚Äòbig‚Äô and thoroughly produced. In other words, I wanted to morph 2001 tropes into a 2017 production sensibility.

Finally ‚Äî and this might be the goal that‚Äôs dearest to me ‚Äî is to push electronic music in a different direction. As electronic music essentially converged with pop in 2016 (for the second time in the last 10 years, the other time being 2011), I think it‚Äôs pushed a lot of artists away from risk-taking and passion projects. In the last two years, for most artists, all they really had to do was compromise their style by like 30% and add a safe, inoffensive tropical vocal to have a chance at having a hit ‚Äî and I think for many, that temptation was too much.

In my opinion, electronic music is at its best and its healthiest when new, exciting, unexpected things are happening. This is a genre that thrives on novelty. And to be totally clear, I don‚Äôt think that Virtual Self, early 2000s trance, or digital abstract art are the solution or the future at all. But!! I DO think this style is something unexpected, and something I‚Äôm uniquely poised to make, because I love it. And that‚Äôs the precedent I want to set, or at least the approach I want to remind other artists of.

I really, really, truly, love electronic music, and I want it to be as good as it can be. I hope that by doing something unexpected, I can shake things up and hopefully inspire other artists to do something weird.

Anyway, please listen and enjoy!

Thanks for taking the time to hear about all this.

‚Äì Porter Robinson

TJR - Dude is hilarious. Great mic energy and personality suited to Melbourne Bounce. Really knows how to hype up a crowd, and is the most unique stage personality I've seen. 

Kaskade - Rarely talks. Knows the right time to speak.

Dmitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike - This is my personal preference as I know many will disagree, but I find Like Mike to be a great hype Man. Yes, they are overrated (at least in DJ mag), but their live sets bring so much energy.

4553,Share your top 10 house songs,"Recently got into EDM this summer and I've fallen in love. Growing up I would listen to mostly Hip-hop, reggae/dancehall and R&amp;B. Although I love the lyrics, I've always been fascinated with the production and the beats of the songs. House has been the perfect combo for me as I can listen to lyrics and zone out to the beat at the same time. Right now my library is at 256 songs and is slowly growing. I try to find at least 3-5 new songs daily that I really like. Anyways without further ado here are my top 10. 

1.  Felon - Colour

2. Zak Joshua - Figure It Out

3. Cassian - Need U Now

4. Zeds Dead &amp; Oliver Heldens - You Know

5. Todd Terje - Inspector Norse

6. Benny Benassi - Illusion

4554,Confusion around genres,"Ok, so i'm fairly music savvy in the metal genre and can quite easily identify bands that go into sub-genres. I've grown up with metal but i've also loved Electronic/EDM/Techno/House etc... since a very young age. 

Most of the stuff i like is the more progressive and modern things. But having a discussion with my boss who is a massive old-school electronic, house, techno fan. Every time i say i'm really into a song and he asks what genre it is, i will say the closest thing to it as possible and he will immediately say that it is not that genre.

So i'm wondering what genres you would call these few songs:

T-Mass &amp; Enthic - Can You Feel It

But why do people want it so bad? In my opinion they had their run. They were making some of the greatest progressive/electro house music of all time. 

What would a reunion bring other than disappointment? They aren‚Äôt going to make a song that tops Don‚Äôt You Worry Child. Axwell Ingrosso have seemed to gone full pop EDM and have brought our anger in fans after dropping a radio oriented version of Dreamer. 

I just don‚Äôt see what it would bring to EDM music. Especially considering Steve Angelo didn‚Äôt want to be making music with Axwell and Ingrosso while the group was still together. ",EDM,1515077233,JohnLucJ,47,70,True,2018-01-04

Thanks for taking the time to listen to nominations, vote, and participate. We'd love to hear your feedback as to what we can improve upon next year - for example, do we need to increase the number of genres? Make smaller/broader genre buckets? While we took a hands off approach this time around, should the mods ""genre police"" the nominations? Or should that be left to the community to decide?

4624,I'd just like to personally say thanks to Nick/Illenium,"Hi there. I recently lost one of my friends much too soon. A close friend of mine passed away about a month ago, and it's made these cold, dark winter months tougher than ever. We did lots of things together and enjoyed going places we shouldn't have been together. I remember the hours before Awake was released, him and I were in some old junkyard, and I wanted to leave a little early to go listen to the album at 12:01am, lol. Either way, I'm a photographer and liked taking pictures of the stars, and he liked breaking in to things under the cover of darkness - so naturally, we were pretty good friends. I took some of my favorite pictures of all time with him nearby. Recently in a sort of ode to him, I went back to a bunch of places we (may or may not have) trespassed together and took these pictures:

https://photos.app.goo.gl/SI2I5iAsoNcFsZ1c2

Those lyrics from Beautiful Creatures have been hitting me hard, and accurately represent how I've been feeling these last few weeks.

I would just like to say, Nick, your music has been making me cry lately, which is unlike me - but at the same time, it continuously brings back a flood of good memories I had with my friend, so I'd just like to personally thank you for that. You may have seen me at your Buffalo show, I was front row, your left, I was the one with the really weird blonde afro thing on my head (aka: my hair), you killed it, and you sure as hell better keep it up.

Thanks for reading everyone and just listening to me vent. 

Just remember if you're every having a tough time with life, just think to yourself, ""now here I am, just happy to be alive.""

Since the start of 2017, I have analyzed 84,131 tracks in 24,192 daily top 100 charts on Beatport, JunoDownload &amp; Traxsource to identify the tracks that DJs have downloaded the most.



The tracks are first ranked on their best position in the respective top 100 chart(s) and then on total plays of matching vids on YouTube+SoundCloud. In this way, you see all the #1's followed by all the #2's etc.



Each genre has its own Top 500 ranking and you can play the corresponding vids on YouTube. If you visit from a laptop, you can **add tracks to your Spotify (see the green buttons)** or just listen to music from smartphones.

4663,Need recommendations for work party,"Hey everyone! I have a work holiday party coming up (60ish ppl of varying ages from 22-60, but mostly 22-40). We are skipping out on a DJ this year because they're all terrible in my city unfortunately. Instead, everyone's contributing to a communal playlist that one person will run for the dance floor. 

I want to contribute some EDM/house flavour to this playlist and need some options. It's an open-bar event, so no issue with people not ""getting into it"" later in the night. However I need something that is not too hardcore and techy, and it needs to be ""sing-alongy"", always upbeat, and appeal easily to a general crowd that may not be into this type of music. This way it still fits in along with the other type of music there (think typical wedding reception music like golden-age hip-hop, pop, oldies, country, etc). I realize timing is key for EDM to start playing during a party. 

Also needs to be on Spotify! Any help will be greatly appreciated; thank you!

4689,Fitting in? Finding like minded producers?,"I study Creative Music Technology at Falmouth University in the UK, hardly anyone I know produces, and the ones that do sort of have a disregard for my music as it's not mainstream/chart orientated. I love all types of music and make quite a few different types as well. Lately I have been drawing inspiration from artists such as Illenium, Excision, MONXX, Space Laces, Sullivan King and Virtual Riot, no one I know listens to anything even somewhat similar, so they also pass off on my music. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this kind of music in an interesting way because they categorize it as s***.

I just want to connect with other like minded musicians but in a location over saturated by singer song writers it's kind of difficult, It's sad to say have been going here for over a year and a half I haven't made any friends on my course and the ones I did make friends with no longer talk to me.

4750,Was disappointed by EDC Orlando. Are all festivals like this?,"I have 2 major disappointments.

1. I felt like nobody was really dancing. I wanted to go crazy and get lost in a huge crowd of people going crazy and dancing their ass off. But most people were just kind of bobbing along to the music or lightly moving. It wasn't until a drop that people would go crazy and then go back to just sort of swaying. The only people I saw actually dancing, were the people who were actually good at dancing...and those people were usually on the outer edges of the crowd or way in the back. I can't dance with them, I can't dance at all. I thought this would be remedied by going to the Neon Garden where its all house and trance music, but even there people barely danced. I would try to look around for a group of people dancing so I could push past to them...but couldn't really find much.

2. I wanted to hear the songs that I knew by the artists I went to see. But I was so disappointed. I feel like every DJ played the same songs over and over again. I got so tired of hearing Wonderwall, Vengaboys, Sandstorm, Mask Off, Humble, Purple Lamborghini, Living on a Prayer, Better Off Alone, Still Dre, and Antidote over and over again in every fucking set. I'd be like ""OH SHIT I LOVE THIS SONG"" and they'd play their own song for 30 seconds and then dududududududududu and i think to myself  ""my fucking god ive heard this song 3 fucking times today.""",EDM,1510806313,Tirriforma,35,7,True,2017-11-15

4899,"Hardstyle: one of the most ""misunderstood"" genres","This is directed to a certain type of people that always that hardstyle sounds the same.

Hear me out. You CANNOT listen to 10, 20 or 30 hardstyle songs and say they're all the same. They are not. Sure, like any other genre, some may sound similar (especially if they're from the same artist or if they're ghosting for someone).

First point, there are thousands of HS tracks. Yeah, very reasonable to listen to a few and then give an opinion /s

Secondly, hardstyle is a genre that tunes your ears. What do I mean by this? Well, if you keep listening to it, you'll notice more and more of the tracks' details and, therefore, you'll get a better grasp on the genre and why not every track sounds the same.

And now the kicks. NO MOTHERFUCKER, NOT EVERY KICK IS THE SAME! Geez, clean your ears! You're gonna tell me that a Delete kick and a Radical Redemption kick are the exact same???

The melodies. They are often called ""childish"" or ""cheesy"" and that's debatable. I do find some melodies to be cheesy but, again, NOT ALL HARDSTYLE MELODIES ARE THE SAME! Go listen to Wasted Penguinz and then come back to Radical, I dare you to tell me that they're the same.

Edgy lyrics. I'm kinda biased on this aspect I must say. I'm a sucker for a raw (raw as in rawstyle) ass track with lyrics that urge you to kill everyone, just goes sooooo well with the raw ambience. But yes, they are edgy lyrics haha.

The listeners' age. No, not everyone is 16 years old and even if they were, who cares? ""Oh, look at me, I'm suuuuuuch a grown up listening to my big room/trap/dubstep/etc"". My point is, if you enjoy it and you're not hurting anyone, who cares?

Hardstyle tracks are easy to make. Uhmmm, they're not easiest but I won't delve deep into this, I'll let a producer or a more experienced listener say something about this matter in the comments.

These are the main points I wanted to cover. Just wanted to get this off my chest.

In the end, I know that not everyone needs to like HS, different strokes for different folks. But man, before saying anything I urge people to investigate and give the genre a good chance before they start spewing bullshit. ""I HATE ANGERFIST AND HIS HARDSTYLE!""

4912,2018 NYE - Porter Robinson playing 6 locations in 2 days?,"(re-post from /aves for visibility)

Porter Robinson gave me the most life changing show at EDCLV 2017. Nothing in the world could make me cry more tears of joy than seeing him live as we count down the seconds to 2018. Imagine my surprise when I found out he is throwing all his effort to headline as many shows the weekend of NYE as he can!
Porter Robinson is playing:

Countdown - California (Saturday)  
Decadence - Utah (Sunday)  
Decadence - Colorado (Sunday)  
SnowGlobe - California (Unknown, Sat or Sun)  
Lights All night - Texas (Unknown, Sat or Sun)  

Here is my dilemma. I don't just want to see Porter. I want to experience 2018 with him. I will go to any of these 5 shows as long as he is on stage when the ball drops.

I've tried searching for a confirmation of who will be on stage at midnight for each of these events, and I've found nothing. I really want to start making my plans and reservations for that weekend, but I worry I won't know the set times until a couple of weeks before NYE.

Does anyone have any insight on his headlining tendencies?
Does he usually headline the midnight moment at any of these events?
Are there any announcements I've missed?

4913,We seriously need to chop down the Future Bass,"I tried to learn what is Future Bass by hearing a bunch of tracks and mixes, and those whole lot of tracks I listened to only made me confused and frustrated. It is even more confusing now! I think the time has come to crush the following nonsense: ""...It's not a genre, it's a state of mind.""

1. A loooong time has passed since the first Future Bass movement started in the UK. As a result, It seems Future Bass is now settling down somewhere in the land of EDM-i.e. It's slowly forming its identity-. One evidence is that these days Future Bass tracks are quite easy to group roughly by generic cliches. Does it use trap beats or not? What about wonky synths? Vocal chops? etc.

2. IMO, It is nonsense to say that [KRNE - Movin](https://soundcloud.com/krane/movin-1) and [The Chainsmokers - Roses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyASdjZE0R0) are both the same style of music. They are too different to me. I would never agree that these are 'same' Future Bass.

Even that particular Electro House can be divided more into Big Room, Melbourne Bounce, Complextro, Hard House, etc etc. Why not Future Bass? We need to solve one of the biggest problems of it: Extreme, confusing, and unnecessary(opinion) broadness.

4968,"Honest ""a moment apart"" reviews","Now that it's been a couple weeks and the ""new release mania"" is starting to pass away, I think it is now possible for us to properly react to the biggest release in EDM in recent memory. I know this is probably a weird concept as a defining component in electronic music is its turnover rate.  You listen to a new song or CD while it‚Äôs hot but then it falls into obscurity as soon as something new comes along.  ""A Moment Apart"" is something different, and IMO demands more respect and attention than your standard soundcloud trap remix. 

Therefore, I would love to discuss what we actually think now that it's not shiny and new anymore.  I have scoured the interwebs and I've heard VASTLY differing opinions and reviews from all kinds of different sources. When it's this polarizing you can get into some fascinating arguments and to me, arguing about music is one of my favorite parts of being a music lover (obviously behind actually listening to it).  Does it live up to the standard that's been set by the mythic reverence ""summers end"" and ""in return"" have in many people (definitely mine) minds?  Where does this rank in Odesza's catalogue?  Why did the things that work, work and what were you not feeling and what could they have done to fix it?  Let's hear it.

When first listening to this song, it seems like a boring song with a shitty drop. Yes, the song has generic lyrics and a somewhat catchy melody but it is more than you hear. It incorporates both Illenium's and Gryffin's styles: Illenium's ever popular sidechained polysynths, drum kit and vocal chops and Gryffin's famous guitar melody and somewhat trap style. When combined, it creates a well produced drop that is pretty underrated. The drop, however, sounds weak because Illenium's powerful synths are reduced to include Gryffin's signature guitar but nevertheless still brilliant.",EDM,1505349358,deliriousplays,19,6,True,2017-09-13

4985,Why are you an edm fan?,"EDM is an amazing genre that brings all kinds of different people from ALL DIFFERENT aspects of life together. Unfortunately this sub lately has been only interested in tearing down and demeaning those that are different from you so In another attempt to spread some positivity I wanna know the specific reason you all Love EDM. Just the actual sound agrees  with you the most? is it a specific song or artist? the energy of a live show or festival? A specific memory that ties you to the music? Let's all start remembering why Dance music is more than just drops and bass but a legit artform that has touched us all  ....Crazy stories also greatly encouraged.

Guess I'll go first:  I was always a casual fan of dance music for your general dance music needs. Weddings, parties, the car when no ones watching. Until I went to hulaween '15 and saw odesza I just thought it was all fun but no substance so it didn't have the respectability of other ""more mature"" genres. That all changed the moment I heard ""bloom"" live and truly experienced what the music had to offer. Been hooked ever since, went to 4 festivals last year and will have gone to 7 at the end of this year and after meeting amazing people and having the best times a human could ever have it's easy saying EDM is where my heart lies.

5020,Hey guys. I love you all. I need your help (+ a producers story),"Hey /r/EDM! It's Slinz.

This is of course my favorite subreddit. Discussions and many, many daily great tracks. Even though I'm mostly a reader in here, I decided it was a good idea posting my story and a shout for help.

Sorry if this post is going to be kinda long, I hope you can bare with me and read along! I actually really shortened it down by excluding all the personal shit going on while this was happening, which had an effect on this, but you'll get the most important points with this!

I'm an artist myself, and I dedicate my life to EDM. It is the best in life, and the ONLY thing I need. I've met and talked to SO many great people in the community since I started producing 4 years ago. Laszlo, Project 46, Killabyte, IZECOLD, TheFatRat, Rob Swire (Knife Party), Xan Griffin, Alex Skrindo, Ashley Appollodor (Monstercat singer), Lenso and those are just some of the more famous guys! I've also come to know a lot of upcoming producers who became close friends to me.


All these guys, are not just great producers - they are also great people. There are so many awesome people in the EDM community and I know you guys know too!


I, as an artist, has suffered from a hardcore writers block the last **one and a half year**. It started from me getting to many WIPs, which all us producers know. A lot of my non-producer friends ask me; * ""Why do you delete all those awesome demos?"" * And the answer is simple. Yes, they're great, but I don't LOVE them. I only release tracks that I would've loved myself, if that makes sense. I try to keep my content relevant and not just release everything I've worked with. I tend to try to put a lot of emotions in my tracks as well, if they're summery, happy, sad, madness, melancholia - you name it. I feel like tracks should have soul, and they mostly don't if you can't transfer your feels to them. It's a hard process and it almost never works out. That's why I only have so few tracks released over my 3-4 years of production.


I'd like to share my story with you guys real quick:


I started 4 years ago producing EDM (before then I was composing on the piano and guitar), and got together with my awesome singing friend, NiCo. I worked so much on this track called Other Side, and managed to finish it with NiCo after 1 year of work. Now it's almost 3 years since I released that as a CC release. I sent it to this promoter called Argofox, who used to release CC content, and he uploaded it! I was so happy. It got many thousand views. Eventually I got it on Spotify. I started working on more tracks, and things were going super awesome. That's when I got my first 100 followers. A guy contacted me and says he was collecting a small community of great upcoming producers. The guy was studying management and eventually I ended up as one of the luckier guys from the community that got to be managed because he believed in me. Whilst that, I befriended a lot of the guys from the community. He was so awesome getting contact to a lot of great people for me, making art and so on. He was the best. After 2-4 releases and a year, the contract expired and we decided to part our ways, since he was trying to get me to do new stuff, and I couldn't stop doing Progressive House. I had so much passion to the genre at the time. Before me and my manager parted, he told me he had talked to Billy (founder of NCS) and had assured a release to my track 'How It Feels'. I was SO, SO, SO hyped you can't even imagine it. At the end of the contract he said, ""I'll make sure the release goes smoothly and then I'll proceed managing someone else."" Eventually he stopped replying to me, and Billy as well. So it ended with me having to release it on the singers very small, but cute label. I, with my friend Dolthon, writes the lyrics for my tracks. We put SO much time, effort and passion to them. I also write the vocal melodies for all tracks, except the ones where NiCo sings (he also writes his own lyrics).


Then some day my little brother, who draws a lot, tells me ""I found your song 'Other Side' in this YouTube video and it has over 3 million views!"" I was so happy.

I started doing Melodic House, and collabed a lot with a great guy called CelDro. We became really close friends! I can tell you, he's one of the greatest humans I've talked to. Eventually I got too much of Melodic House and wanted to try something new. My manager would've loved me proceeding to try different genres. I worked on over 40 WIPs and proceeded to work on the 3 I loved the most. But they never got to be 100% done. So I kept working, and working, and working on them. Eventually I drained myself from energy and passion, and I had to get a break. I really needed my manager, he would know what to do. He could help me. He could tell me that the tracks were great and didn't need more work. He could contact all the right guys and keep everything scheduled.

But I got stuck. So I took a while off SoundCloud, trying to isolate the problems in my DAW (Digital Audio Workstation for those who don't know). It never worked out.

Then I eventually (one and half years after - it's *now* for those who didn't catch it) told myself that they're perfect the way they are and need to work hard to get them released on my own.

I have tried for many months now, but I never get a hold of the right guys. I worked so hard to make it work, but unfortunately it didn't.

Now, I have this awesome different track I want to release. It features awesome vocals from two of my great friends, a girl and a guy (it's a duo). It has beautiful lyrics and a great melody! Also the drums are tight *af* (‡πëÀÉÃµ·¥óÀÇÃµ)Ÿà

I don't want to link the track as it is not released yet and I want to keep it a secret for you guys!

**Help here!**
Now, I'm asking for your help. If anyone has some great contacts for a lovely Future Bass track, or are looking to manage an inspired artist, then please contact me. I really need a manager again! I promise to love you, ayy

For those just interested, I can PM you a link to the track if you want!

Anyways, [here's my SoundCloud](http://www.soundcloud.com/Slinz-1) I hope you want to know what my music sounds like


It was awesome sharing a shortened version of my story for you guys!

I'm **EXTREMELY** grateful for all the support I've got from the most loyal followers of all time &lt;3 And HUUUUUGE shoutout to my boy Angus! &lt;3 Love you bro!

And if you have **ANY** questions about my story, production or ANYTHING feel free to ask!

Sorry for the kind of long post.

LOVE YOU GUYS

First time on this sub, pardon any mistakes.

I'm trying to make an intro for a YouTube channel i'm starting and i'm trying to find a good break to use as my introduction music. I like electronic music in general but frenchcore, house, dance, electropop, electroswing are some of my favorite styles.

I'm looking for something like these :  
[Vexento - Pixel Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSaLtRksFlM)  
[Tobu - Candyland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIrCDAV3EgI)  
[Professor Kliq - Plastic and Flashing Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSbljg7OcCU)  

**tl;dl :** looking for a happy music, with a relatively fast tempo, and a nice break. It's better if the music is explicitly free to use but if not i can always ask the creator directly.

Anyone else feel the same? the only benefit is probably for the DJ's , visually.

also, half of the people jump up too early, too late, or just don't give a shit. people only sit down because of the implication. they don't want to be the only one standing in a group of 4 people so they sit. then finally you find yourself jumping to a drop you usually would just find average.

5160,[Unpopular Opinion] Am i the only who dislikes KSHMR's recent changes in some of his tracks?,"First of, i'm a huge KSHMR fan, and i have been supporting him ever since Megaladon. What i'm about to say is not meant to bash KSHMR's work in any way, but to help him become a better producer.

***

When KSHMR first played his track Extreme in his Tomorrowland 2016 set, i loved it. The vocals were great and so was the drop. But when it released, the vocals were changed, and once again, so was the drop. The vocals went from great to meh, and the new ones sounded emotionless.
Some vocal chops were also added to the drop which i thought were unnecessary, but that's more subjective.

Now comes The Serpent. When he first revealed it in Welcome to KSHMR, everyone loved it, especially the break and the melody. But listening to the leaked version now, i'm dissapointed that he changed the track. It doesn't feel epic anymore, and although i still like it, it's nowhere near what it was.

What i'm trying to ask here is: Why do DJ's feel the need to change the tracks last minute, even tho everyone loved it before?

5189,Thoughts on DJs/producers that talk during their sets?,"So when I first started listening to EDM and live sets of artists. I loved the DJ/producer talking into the mic and getting the crowd hyped. My friends that were 1 or 2 years more experienced all would complain about it, but I didn‚Äôt see the problem. I saw it as a way to connect with the artist on stage and for them to connect with us, the crowd. 

Now that I am half way through my 3rd festival season, I have had a huge change of heart (or mind?).  I realized that I am not trying to connect with the artist. The artist is laying out their collage of sound for me to experience. I am connecting with the music, which THEN brings me closer to the artist. I have literally had shows ruined because the DJ refused to just play music and kept talking. 

I think Above and Beyond have the best idea in the industry to correct this. If you are unfamiliar with their shows, they type on the screen behind them so they can still communicate without interrupting the music. Then other artists do a great job of balancing talking and playing music, like Armin Van Buuren and Laidback Luke.

I‚Äôm just curious about other peoples thoughts.

Edit: I think the general consensus is in moderation, but what does that mean to you? I feel like intro speech is ok, like 3 or 4 ""let's go"" or whatever and then a thank you at the end. Any more and it gets distracting. ",EDM,1500560919,txby432,56,10,True,2017-07-20

5223,"Various EDM Playlists: Festival Bangers, Chill EDM, Pop EDM &amp; More","Hello r/edm. This past weekend I had the opportunity to make some new playlists. They can all be found below:

[Festival Bangers](https://open.spotify.com/user/keivan32/playlist/16Uxty4DHxmB2Mi6TUy6SS): is exactly what the title suggests. I selected songs that would go off in a live setting. Although mainly consisting of bigroom/festival house, there's plenty of other genres mixed in, including trap, hardstyle, psytrance etc. 

[Chill EDM](https://open.spotify.com/user/keivan32/playlist/54NterC75IkY8X8ZftaTYf): this is the perfect playlist for just letting it play in the background and relaxing. Has genres such as tropical house, future bass, chill out etc. 

[Pop EDM](https://open.spotify.com/user/keivan32/playlist/6piMYJKZUSXnKsTRUmm4NR): I know we all have our mixed on pop music and how it's infusing with edm. I'm personally not the biggest fan of it, but some of these pop EDM songs are quite catchy and have their time &amp; place. This is perfect for someone just getting into edm, such as a sibling who wants easy to listen to, accessible music. 

[House Time](https://open.spotify.com/user/keivan32/playlist/1bj4pfMHZZ4C52zXeLXoMn): for this one, the key was the groove. I tried to avoid that ""mainstream future house"" sound (although I couldn't resist in some cases, such as tchami's after life). Contains some strictly house, a bit of deep house and basically whatever I thought was groovy as shit. 

[The Feels](https://open.spotify.com/user/keivan32/playlist/5BDxjXrU1GuhqUh8dzRSbm): this playlist has what I consider to be emotional songs, whether that's lyrics with a powerful message, or an emotional melody. This playlist is designed to make u 'feel' something, perfect for those times when you're feeling nostalgic. 

[Unique EDM](https://open.spotify.com/user/keivan32/playlist/0WUdXCla76LSmrI7gidpgb): creativity is something I find lacking in today's scene, so this playlist is basically is filled with songs that have unique sound design, or other things you don't hear in an everyday edm track. The genres for this one are all over the place.

[Underrated EDM](https://open.spotify.com/user/keivan32/playlist/7ENs9nn85vAWAGEi1kAhCi): songs that I think deserve more attention because they're so damn good. 

All of these playlists were curated from my 2000+ library on Spotify. I'm sure if u do some digging, this can be a treasure trove of new music. Looking forward to hearing your feedback. Also, willing to hear out suggestions for the pop EDM playlist! And let me know which playlist you liked!

It sounds kind of like Martin Garrix - Lions in the Wild but that's not it, I remember there being no vocals and it sounding less ""poppy"" than Martin's song

Check it out and see if your favorites are included (feedback welcome)!","A while back y'all loved my site RemixRotation and many of you are using it every day (paging u/BobbyHarrington u/catsnstuff97 u/adtr007 u/Joekre u/InterracialMartian u/timmytwonips u/gainzAndGoals)
https://www.reddit.com/r/EDM/comments/67g9e4/check_out_my_free_edm_music_service_it_is_a/ 


In short, RemixRotation is a free YouTube player for electronic music loaded with videos that correspond to tracks that DJs are buying from Beatport, Juno and Traxsource.


I have just put out the best-of-2017-so-far, in 27 genres. These will be updated regularly so make sure you bookmark it or sign up for the site notification (site is updated each day and the notification is sent out just once each week).


The genre rankings are organized into continuous playlists or you can just play individual tracks. Since my last update post, I have also added the shuffle button -- use it to make it work like a radio/channel (but you can still skip tracks) and 3 genres: Leftfield, Glitch Hop, Funky &amp; Jacking House.


The rankings are for tracks released and charted during the calendar 2017. Positions are determined based on the best ranking in the sales chart(s) and the total number of days in the chart(s).


If you visit from your desktop-laptop-tablet you can see green Spotify buttons for most tracks to add them to playlists in your account.


Bonus: if your favorite track is ""missing"" or you are old school and believe that the music used to so much better back in the day, then you should check out this page with the best-of-2016 for all of 2016.


As far as I know, my creation is the most comprehensive chart in electronic music. Here are some of the more followed genres

5291,Favorite/Least Favorite EDC LV 2017 sets?,"Whose sets at EDC LV 2017 were your favorite/least favorite and why? 

From what I've listened to so far:

**Favorites**: 



**SLANDER**: They had a killer set with high energy the entire time and released a few IDs as well. Bringing in a ton of headbangers throughout their set, they also meshed a few throwbacks in between as well.




**Laidback Luke**: Didn't speak much at all and let the music speak for itself. Bringing in some Moombahton, Trap, Big Room, and Spanish music, he had the crowd hyped up big time. Laidback Luke is truly one of the best at DJing in the world.




**Dillon Francis**: Brought a lot to EDC including some new Moombahton and an unreleased track with NGHTMRE. One of his better sets I've listened to from Dillon.




**Alesso**: He was disappointing for me with his Ultra 2017 set but brought a good amount of his authentic progressive house which was great see. He also mixed in some hip-hop along the way as well. Overall very impressed with this set.

A few others that I enjoyed include GTA, Flosstradamus, and NGHTMRE.



**Least Favorite**: I haven't heard anything I didn't overall enjoy so far. We all know DJ Khaled was a laughing stock but seems like a solid festival set wise!

As it is being livestreamed on [RedBull.TV](https://www.redbull.tv/live/AP-1RD4X1P711W11/electric-daisy-carnival) we can all watch together and have a chat while we listen to the music!

The stream starts **11:30pm EDT / 8:30 PDT time, which is 5:30AM CEST or 13:30 AEST** on the following day.

We already had a chat session like this for Ultra Miami, which was a huge success and funny. I hope I can see most of the people, or even more, back at the EDC Stream.

**This also means that this week's listening party is canceled for this week. You guys can still join and listen to some music, but it won't be an official listening party.**

5372,/r/edm weekly listening party in discord on the 2nd of June!,"Hey hey guys,

Another week, another friday, another listening party. This is going to go down as usual at **11PM CEST / 5PM EDT** in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cGXSEBV) !

# What is Discord

[Download/Use Discord here. Works in the Browser as well!](https://discordapp.com/)

Discord is a chat, originally for gamers, but also perfect for communities. It has a textchat with multiple channels, similiar to an IRC network. You can write in there with the other people and you'll be able to see the history and what you've missed.

It also has voice channels, where our listening party is going to happen. You just click on one of the voice channels and you can speak with others (if you have a microphone and it's setup correctly obviously). The second channel *music* is for our weekly listening parties or just generally if youre listening to some music. In the music channel your microphone is automatically muted and you're only able to hear the Music Bot.

# The Music Bot

We have a music bot that joins the channel at exactly 11pm CEST/5pm EDT with some music. I will be in charge of making that happen.

Everybody can use the bot to listen music tho! Go into the music voice channel, and start a song like this: *+play LINK*

The LINK is either a YouTube or a SoundCloud link, the bot downloads the song into its cache and plays it for you. You can also add another song just right after, there's a working queue. So you can interact by adding music yourself to the bot :)

# Rules

Well, nobody can speak. The normal rules are written down in the textchannel #rules. Other than that, you're allowed to put in any EDM music you want at any point. If the majority doesn't like it, you can do a skipvote over *+skip*, if the majority of people write that, the current song gets skipped.

At the listening parties the rule is also, that the music you're about to put in, needs to be a release of the past 7 days. That way we can keep a fresh listening party every week.

I will be making more of playlists, I intended to do Spinnin', Armada, Firepower Records, Mad Decent, Mau5trap or other one's that you think I should do. The only problem is that they take time, but I'll get around to them eventually

Hi reddit, I am making a video (that can potentially double as a school project for the next year) that involves EDM and its genres. Aside from a summarization of different genres, my video will revolve around:

* Mainstream (songs that climb charts) and underground (songs that don't climb charts and you have to search for them, and that include songs with millions played)
subgenres of each genres (a maximum of three)
* Popular songs
* Artists. 

I'd love to see your input on this topic. You don't have to fill them all, anything, even not much, is very appreciated. I think it's kind of cheating to ask for information for your own project, but tbh this is just something I do for fun as I love EDM and making videos.

We‚Äôve been alluding to working on a content-rich project that we are hoping will generate significant amounts of discussion in the community, and we‚Äôve asked for the community to nominate other users to help us in this project. Without further ado, we are announcing this project: the Fundamentals of r/EDM!

**What is this project?**

Community members have asked for a resource for the sub that contains the ‚Äúbasics‚Äù or ‚Äúkey songs/EPs/albums‚Äù that people should know and would allow newcomers to the scene to more quickly become familiar with the scene‚Äôs history, various genres etc. We would like this Fundamentals of r/edm to be a community-sourced project that features what we and the community believe to be the fundamental tracks and albums newcomers should listen to and become familiar with. Think of this as a ‚Äústarter pack‚Äù of sorts for joining r/edm! That being said, we expect that even long-time contributors will be exposed to previously unexplored music here, too. 

**Who should you nominate?**

We are looking for the community to nominate members who have displayed thoughtful, consistent and positive participation in the sub and who you think have a solid foundational knowledge of edm or any of its associated genres/subgenres. We are not accepting self-nominations, but please nominate other users who you think would be great contributors for this type of project.

**Community Participation and Feedback**

Again, we think it is important that this project be representative of the r/edm community, and so community input and feedback is welcome and encouraged. The final details and structure of this project are fluid, and we are willing to incorporate community ideas to improve the final product. If you have any specific suggestions, feel free to comment here or PM me. Ideally, we envision a static resource listing (with links) songs, EPs and albums that are ‚Äúmust listens‚Äù, with additional discussion threads on these end products.

For some context to see how fast the tide has turned, just think about all the big electro house songs you could name from 2010/11 alone: Sexy Chick, DJ Got Us Fallin Love, The Time (Dirty Bit), Only Girl In the World, Club Can't Handle Me, I Gotta Feeling, I Like It, Party Rock Anthem, Without You, You Make Me Feel, On the Floor...the list goes on. Let's not forget about 2012's Gangnam Style explosion haha

Nowadays? *crickets*

It seems like trap/dancehall, whatever you want to call it, has completely taken over. I feel like even back in 2013 there was kind of a healthy balance between trap, dubstep and electro house. You could have your Harlem Shakes but you could also have the newest Avicii anthem. Now electro house is pretty much non-existent in pop culture. There hasn't been a single house song in the top 10 since This Is What You Came For (we've got Rockabye right now, but you could argue that's more dancehall). And I do like trap and dubstep. A lot (DJ Snake, Seven Lions and Adventure Club come to mind). And the new Chainsmokers/Coldplay collab had a great vibe. But it's almost all I hear at parties anymore: 808s, 808s, 808s. What happened to four on the floor?

5428,EDM Saved My Life,"Back in high school, I was into a lot of different music that wasn't EDM. My brother was though. I was dating a girl for over a year and then I joined the military. She left me 2 days after our 1 year mark because of it. I was destroyed. I thought my whole world came crashing down in a searing inferno. Then one day, I came across some of Dillon Francis's work as well as Madeons. After I was listening to their latest albums at the time, I dove straight into the EDM well and I continued to getting sucked in further. EDM gave me a purpose again. It got rid of the searing inferno and gave me light. 

People often ask me why I listen to it because they think it's just garbage. They don't understand. EDM is about connecting people together and giving us a way of expressing ourselves. I've met so many awesome people through this music that I can never look back.

To start off I have always been fascinated with the sounds and ability to make me move that edm has, however its always been too big of a genre to enter for me. I listen to a lot of hip hop but am looking to expand my horizons.

I heard some Matoma remixes of Biggie which ultimately peaked my interest. Not sure if hes considered bad or good here or not but I'd like to get more artists to listen to.

Any artists that have good remixes of hiphop or just have chill edm in general? I like vocals on the songs, i'm not looking to be at a festival in my car, more of shit to smoke and chill to but also beach vibes and shit people will move to.

Some other songs I liked and recently heard:
Kings of summer- ayokay ft quinn xcii and another day in paradise by quinn xcii.

#**Biography**

&gt;The alias of electronic musician and producer Harley Edward Streten, Flume makes atmospheric dance music inspired by house and U.K. garage. Born in Australia, Streten began producing his own music in his early teens. Several years later, he won a competition held by Future Classic and subsequently signed with the label to release a 2011 EP featuring the track ""Sleepless."" The following year, he delivered his debut self-titled solo album, which featured guest appearances from Chet Faker, Jezzabell Doran, and Moon Holiday, among others. In his homeland, it topped the ARIA album chart and went double platinum; in the U.S., it was issued on the Mom + Pop label. A deluxe edition of the debut followed in November of 2013 with cred-enhancing contributions from Ghostface Killah, Boldy James, M.O.P., and Killer Mike. The same month, he released his and Faker's collaborative Lockjaw EP, and he toured the U.S. with Disclosure. Several ARIA awards -- including Producer of the Year, Breakthrough Artist, and Best Dance Release -- were handed to him the next month. Streten spent the next couple of years touring and released the single ""Some Minds,"" a collaboration with Miike Snow's Andrew Wyatt, in 2015. His 2016 sophomore set, Skin, featured collaborations with Tove Lo, AlunaGeorge, Little Dragon, Vic Mensa, and Beck. ~ Matt Collar, Rovi

Is this a stylistic choice and they're trying to be ""mellow"" here? They just sound muffled or something. I noticed it mainly in a lot of Yellow Claw's new music (Without You comes to mind immediately.) 

I also felt the same on ""Feel Good"" by Illenium/Gryffin. It's such a sick drop but it sounds like they put some sort of muffle over it for some reason. 

Do they listen to this in their cars before it releases and not realize that they have the urge to turn up the volume once the drop hits? Just something I'm curious about and figured I'd post here.",EDM,1492644745,AhmadA96,7,4,True,2017-04-19

I'm the guy that works on the discord, we were over 120 people at Ultra weekend and I'd love to keep the discord active in the future, outside of events.

That is why I am introducing weekly listening parties on the discord, **every Friday 11pm CEST**, we will chat in discord and play new music(I'd say music released in the past 7 days so we are not that repetitive every week).

For that we have our music bot, where music that is posted on the Reddit in the past 7 days will be played so we can listen to it in voice. The voice in the channel will be muted except for the bot, and chatting will be available in the normal #general chat.

Time zones are:

11PM CEST

9PM UTC

5PM EDT

2PM PDT

4AM AEST (I'm sorry Australians)

________________________________

I hope we will see you this Friday, if theres any improvements you can think of, just message me.

I'm searching for super emotional and good vocoder tracks. Can be both with or without music. Usually people wouldn't call it ""EDM"" but it sure as hell can be. If people don't know what I'm talking about, listen to Imogen Heap - Hide And Seek and you will know what I mean. But we've all heard too much of that song. But I really like the sound of a vocoder - it's soothing, emotional and chill. And also, I'm not talking about that funky Nu Disco, stuff like Daft Punk. I'm about that chill, emotional vibe at the moment!

.

Here's a few favorite of mine, brought to you by love.

.

*√∂ - Lullaby*

.

*√∂ - Everyone_Has_A_Reason_To_Pray*

.

*Pentatonix - Can't Help Falling In Love With You*

5556,REQUEST: MINDBLOWING/TRIPPY DROPS,"Hey guys, looking for drops similar to the one at 1:00 and throughout the song in this porter robinson remix: 
[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiMJ6Sy2ph4)

I'm into lots of different electro genres (future bass, deep house, downtempo, ambient, edm...) but I thought this was the best sub to post this in, if not please advise me otherwise.

Basically any electro song that you think has a mind-blowing drop (the drop itself rather than the build up), I know it's a wide description, could be because it's unexpected, trippy bass, or anything that you feel makes it mind-blowing :)

#**Hey guys!**

Welcome to the second Song of the Day thread!

In case you missed our [CHANGELOG](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDM/comments/62wise/new_layout_redm_v2_changelog_community_feedback/) thread (where we discussed in detail, the new layout and all the new components of the subreddit), I'll just give you a brief rundown of what **Song of the Day** is.

Every day of the week we will feature one song to discuss.  They will always be new (within the last 30 days) *EXCEPT* for Throwback Thursday, where of course, an oldie will be featured.  The daily categories are as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

* Mainstream Monday - Songs belonging in the popular mainstream
* Trance Tuesday - Songs belonging to the umbrella Trance genre
* Wicked Wednesday - Songs that go hard in the bass department.  Including, but not limited to Dubstep, Trap, Drum n' Bass, etc...
* Throwback Thursday - Songs over a year old
* Future Friday - Songs that have elements of the umbrella Future genre
* House Saturday - Songs that have elements of the umbrella House genre
* Big Room Sunday - Songs that have elements of the umbrella Big Room genre

&amp;nbsp;

For the first week of **SOTD**, the mods will pick the song.  And then, for each daily thread we will include a poll with the top selections for you to vote on for next week's spotlight!

#ANYWAYS!

On to today's spotlight!  It's Wednesday, so that means it is **Wicked Wednesday**, and the first song is:

I was on Paul van Dyk's soundcloud and a song came on that sounded like an older trance song with lyrics like ""they can't catch us if we just keep running"" . It's got a simple beat and those lyrics were repeated in different fragments throughout.

I've gone back and searched thru everything on PvDs channel but I can't find it again and I think I mightve jumped to someone elses.

5584,Artists/Remixes for lovers of Emo/Pop Punk/indie?,"Hey folks. I'm an emo/scene kid that grew up to like EDM, and it's occurred to me that I don't know of many, or any, artists that do good remixes of old emo/poppunk stuff or modern emo type music? It's probable that I just don't keep up on new music, but I'm getting into DJ'ing and really want to bring that angsty stuff to the dance floor. There's such a big divide, it feels, between electronic music and live music and I could really use some help finding stuff to start with.

Still learning what genres of EDM I enjoy, but dubstep/drumstep/trap tend to be yesses. House and psytrance not so much.
Don't care so much about genre as much as vibe, and I usually want something heavy... or bubbly.

Y'all can laugh, but I do love me some Skrillex, and he's an obvious starting point. I've also been moderately obsessed with one of Smalltown DJ's best of mixes because they had a lot of indie feeling type stuff.
Some bands I love/would love to find remixes of include Murder By Death, Mother Mother, Panic! At The Disco, Fall Out Boy, Cute Is What We Aim For, Relient K, All Time Low, Hellogoodbye, Hawthorne Heights, Silverstein, Mae, We The Kings, Show Me The Skyline, My American Heart, Say Anything, Boys Like Girls, Ten Second Epic, Breathe Carolina, Escape The Fate, The Mascara Story, The Academy Is, Faber Drive, Metro Station, Devil Wears Prada..
But seriously anything pop punk, screamo, emo..
If you have any good remixes up your sleeve, or know of any artists to check out that you can recommend please send them my way!!

Into the sunset - Mako (I love most mako songs)
Roses - chainsmokers
Oceans away - Arizona
Catch &amp; release (deepens remix) - Matt Simmons
Sunset lover - petit biscuit

I feel like that love of heavy bass transitioned itself from listening to super heavy metal. While the 2 categories of music are SO different, I feel like they actually have a lot of commonalities. Idk I just love talking about music because it is my life and I'm wondering if there's a big group of metal people that made the transition that I myself have made.

If you were one of the few lucky that got invited, you got to see Alunageorge throw down a funky house set for Mixmag at the Lab LA for FREE, with open bar.

Of course, if you happened to be at Emo Nite at the Echoplex, you got to see Dillon Francis (I mean, Preston) put down a fun throwback emo set, with a surprise set featuring the Chainsmokers right after.

Most other cities would be lucky to have one show on a weekend night of this caliber. We got 3, on a Tuesday. I love LA!",EDM,1489022291,Lasers_go_pewpew,0,3,True,2017-03-08

5692,Is anyone getting tired of EDM?,"You know that feeling when you hear a drop for the first time and you just know it's great? I don't ever get that feeling anymore, and it's kind of depressing, because I am so in love with electronic music and it is sad that I am not enjoying newer material in the scene as much. Don't get me wrong, EDM and electronic music is and will always be my favorite genre of music for sure. But no new tracks I listen to these days give me the same sensation as it did back when one of my favorite artists would put out something new around 2013-2014. Some artists I can refer to are Skrillex, Dillon Francis, Yellow Claw, Porter Robinson, etc. No new tracks give me that great feeling anymore, only old stuff does for the most part.

Is that because I am just nostalgic for the old music, or is electronic music just straight up getting worse as the years go on? Sometimes I will discover something now that was from 2013 and be like ""wow that's really good!"" And it will almost give me that feeling. Tbh I haven't been feeling the new artists like Marshmello &amp; Illenium nearly as much as the ones I got into.

Does anyone else have this problem? I don't know why I haven't been enjoying new material in the scene and it honestly makes me feel kinda depressed :/

5702,Monthly Favourites Playlist by r/edm - Voting!!,"###MUST BE RELEASED IN FEBRUARY

Hey everyone! I thought it would be a cool idea to do a monthly favourites playlist on Spotify, voted by the users of r/edm!

At the end of each month I will post a voting thread (like this one here) and we will all vote on our favourite tracks of the month.

###Rules

* Your votes must be electronic music. It can be any genre or sub genre.

* Vote for your 5 favourite tracks of the month. Put a lot of thought into it because you can only choose 5. The order does not matter.

* Your selections must have come out in February. I will check to make sure.

* Make sure your track is available on spotify.

###after 1 week I will tally the results and make a playlist. Those with the most votes will appear at the top of the playlist and descend. And then I will share with everyone!

I think this will be an excellent way to recap each month and its most popular and loved tracks.

###Let the voting COMMENCE.

*Mods I sent you a message a while ago with no reply, so I hope this is alright. It doesnt need to be stickied or anything. Just a personal project.

5722,"I'm looking to grow my Spotify playlist, and there's a kind of ""subsection"" of EDM I'm looking for, but I don't know how to find it.","I was introduced to EDM about, five years ago? I still love it, and my playlist is filled with a lot of today's popular EDM songs, but I'm looking for the original music that got me into the genre what seems like an eternity ago.

I used to use a service called plug.dj (RIP, you won't be forgotten) that basically was kind of like a crowdsourced playlist. You'd wait your turn and you'd play a song for the entire room, which could be sometimes 1000 people. It introduced me to tons of amazing EDM music that I'd love to listen to again to take me back to that time.

This was probably what was popular at the time, so I'll name a couple songs that I can for sure remember and maybe you can lead me to others or give me the tools to search up this music.

what I remember (I'm guessing this is 2012-2013 stuff):

* [KDrew - Bullseye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r7-g5fOF2c)

* [OVERWERK - 12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIvQvIEsHZM) possibly one of my all time favorites, it's not on spotify though...
* [Cash Cash - Overtime](https://www.google.com/search?q=overtime+cash+cash&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8)
* [Benny Benassi - Cinema - Skrillex Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaIZ0mUJzr0) Okay, let's be honest, everyone's heard this one. But it's around the time and I still like it. Speaking of Skrillex...
* [Skrillex - Bangarang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJVmu6yttiw) Another one everyone and thier mother has heard.
* [Delta Heavy - Get By](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cOt9UcYGOU) Amazing music video

That's about all I can think of. Maybe I'm just chasing a dream and I won't be able to find any more music to take me back to that time of my life, but, hey, if you could help me out that would be much appreciated.

Which brings me to my issue. I work with a majority of people twice my age who constantly put down festivals/EDM claiming why would anyone want to pay money to 'take drugs and listen to random noise'. I'm quick to disagree saying the main reason I go is to enjoy the music that I like and have a great time with friends.

I don't let them affect my views on going to festivals or listening to EDM, but it's very frustrating having to explain the scene to (ignorant?) people. 

Anyone else agree?",EDM,1487145666,BLVCK1,4,11,True,2017-02-15

Started out very similar to this song (I know it's a link to a YouTuber and not a song, the intro song is relevant and sounds nearly note for note to what I mean): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guO4vxCDknw&amp;t=7s",EDM,1487146237,Afro_N1nja11,2,6,True,2017-02-15

If it helps, the other songs played were either Martin Garrix and some were very MG-sounding (except for the Script's Hall of Fame - don't know where the fuck that came from)

I remember when the names Ti√´sto, Paul Van Dyk, Armin Van Buuren, Johan Gielen, Safri Duo prompted the weirdest faces amongst my Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit friends. Nowadays you're a nobody if as an artist you havent recorded a track with some DJ.

The first song that came up after I charged the iPod was ""Holding on to Nothing - Agnelli and Nelson"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDWTxaM0mqA) and after getting goosebumps because that song is THAT good, it hit me, its not nostalgia, the song REALLY is good, it feels fresh and with some minor changes could be a recent festival hit.

3. Whom is better?

Personally, I don't really like Marshmello at all. He made it to the top by being cock ridden by people like Skrillex and makes very generic music while there are far more passionate EDM artists out there that really care about their music. After his should I say, distasteful actions towards deadmau (Stalking him at an event, putting the Deadmau logo or thing on the Marshmello helmet etc) I cant help but think he's a scumbag. I'm a sucker for Ritual though, but that is prehaps his only song that i think is good.

Alan walker on the other hand is a pretty solid artist in my opinion. Since I'm a norwegian, and our pathetic population of 5 million is completely desperate for attention (Seriously, when we are mentioned in the outside world we go trough the roof), having Alan walker is quite the thing. In the end, I think his songs are very solid, but I end up feeling that all of his songs basically sound the same if you put them side by side.",EDM,1485381685,AzmodanMaster333,9,1,True,2017-01-25

In 2015 we went to the Xtrema Outdoor festival in the Netherlands, which was then a 1-day festival (Now a 3-day, it seems). Afterwards, we drove to Croatia and raved on Zrce Beach on the island of Pag. 

In 2016 we went to the 5-day Balaton Sound festival in Hungary. 

This year we hunger for new experiences, thus I'm looking for some recommendations:

Any european EDM-festival that takes place around July/August. Preferably 3-5 days. Mainstage genre should revolve around house, but with the possibility of other genres around the festival site. 

Besides festivals, any other european EDM-filled destination has our interest as well.

5996,Who are your favourite producers of 2016?,"Some of mine:

* San Holo

He's a guy that's been on my radar since he released ""Hold Fast"" on Monstercat last year, he's also one of maybe two Future Bass producers I actually like. This year, I really dug a lot of his tracks, specifically; [They Just Haven't Seen It ft. The Nicholas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQbjisWixoU), [Old Days w/Yellow Claw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUR-f7Ozc-k), [OK! w/Jauz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yUUbCpe1J0) and [Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTg5yulUNVg)

* Curbi

Future House isn't a genre I'm a massive fan of, but this guy really brings some much needed variation to the genre. Some of my favourite tracks from him are; [100 Percent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zq_P9y2oj8), [51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SigNOVWlvAk), his [remix](https://soundcloud.com/spinninrecords/eva-simons-sidney-samson-escape-from-love-curbi-remix) of Escape From Love and his [remix](https://soundcloud.com/spinninrecords/cheat-codes-dante-klein-let-me-hold-you-turn-me-on-curbi-remix) of Let Me Hold You.

* Fabian Mazur

This was a guy I had never even heard of before this year, but he's released some absolute Trap bangers in 2016. Here are some of them. [Exhale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X338RvPwHjI) and [Wolves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHESAYwC2Q0) with Snavs, the [UNKWN Flip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APd2d7byF0c) of his track, Fiyah and [Make It Bounce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEnl3cg5MQI). He's got an EP coming out on Spinnin' on December 30th and this is a short [preview](https://www.facebook.com/SpinninRecords/videos/10154231931190679/?hc_ref=PAGES_TIMELINE) of one of the tracks. Unbelievably excited for that, too.

* Bali Bandits

I've been following these guys since Dyro released his edit of their track, ""Welcome"" over two years ago. They've really changed their style since then, but what they're releasing at the moment are really fresh tracks that are incredibly unique and bridge the gap between Future and Electro House. [Hoy Snoof Zha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6PUXN0bFkI), [Oh Baby (Croissant)](https://soundcloud.com/hexagon/bali-bandits-oh-baby-croissant) and most recently, [Kaboom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzBW9NTcU78).

* Goja

These guys have been on top form this year. They're Dyro's protegees and with good reason. Every track they drop is an absolute bomb, whether it be Trap, Electro House, or whatever [The Ballad](https://soundcloud.com/wolvrecords/goja-the-ballad-1) is. Some more of their releases this year: [Avalon](https://soundcloud.com/gojamusic/goja-avalon-original-mix), [Mosh Pit](https://soundcloud.com/wolvrecords/goja-mosh-pit-2) and [Hit Girl w/GLDY LX](https://soundcloud.com/wolvrecords/goja-x-gldy-lx-hit-girl). Their collab with Dyro (known as Robot Bass) is on track for a release in January and it's something I couldn't be more excited about.

* Dyro

The boss started the year strongly with his Set Me Free EP. He's been quiet since but big things are on the way in 2017. Check out his edit of [Spacetunnel](https://soundcloud.com/wolvrecords/prism-funkz-spacetunnel-dyro-edit-1) and his EP in full [here](https://soundcloud.com/wolvrecords/sets/dyro-set-me-free-ep-1)

* Aero Chord

Aero Chord has been one of my favourite trap producers for a while now but this year he really changed things up with his Love &amp; Hate EP. It's well worth a listen if you're into the trap/future sound. Check [it](https://soundcloud.com/monstercat/sets/aero-chord-love-hate-ep) out for yourself. My favourite tracks were The 90s and Until The End w/Fractal.

* Oski

This guy has exploded this year. He dropped two EPs this year. The first was called [The Best](https://soundcloud.com/disciple/sets/thebestep) and was released under Disciple Records. The latest is called [Kid Chrome](https://soundcloud.com/qualitygoodsrecs/sets/oski-kid-chrome-ep-qgr-004). Both EPs are huge and you should absolutely check them out if you're into the trap scene. Look out for the tracks 100 Shot Flow, Flex and On Fire ft. UZ.

Now from what I've gathered, these artists usually come under labels such as Techno/Deep House/Deep Tech/Minimal etc. but the problem is that whenever I search for these particular genres playlists on spotify, I find none of the tracks on those playlists  really enjoyable nor do they sound anything like these live sets, and that they sound kind of... too poppy (for lack of a better term) especially when they're vocal?

And the same applies to a great extent to the subs of the said genres and I find myself not really liking most of the stuff posted on r/deephouse, r/Techno 

In general, it seems everytime I search for live sets of these genres, I'm much more fond of the results found, ie. when I search for 'deep tech' on soundcloud, as opposed to playlists of the same genres on platforms such as spotify.

TL;DR: I love Maceo Plex, Solomun, Tale of Us, but I'm not sure exactly what genre of EDM it is they fall under. I seem to enjoy deep tech/house live-sets found on soundcloud but not the single tracks found on spotify... Help!",EDM,1481203271,Fashish,2,3,True,2016-12-08

6042,Thoughts on Future Genres?,"After the success of [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDM/comments/5fixkg/you_can_get_any_artists_in_the_world_to_make_a/) I have decided to post some more open discussions on r/EDM, as I dont believe it has enough atm, and I always love replying to them!

So today I thought we would talk about Future music genres. Future House, Future Bass etc. Personally, I believe this should be entirely seperate to EDM. Yes, EDM is Electronic Music, and so is Future, but is it Dance music? No. I got into this scene mainly from Future House, but after widening my tastes I see there is more to offer than just that. Future music is mainly lyrical catchy songs that are great to listen to, and I love singing along under my breath whilst relaxing, but do I ever want to dance to it? No. Do I want to see it Live? Mostly No (Few exceptions, some of Flume's tracks are Future based but I want to see him). So what are your thoughts on Future music influencing EDM? Do you think its good for EDM as a whole, or like me, do you want to get rid of it.

6043,Remixes? Good or Bad [Discussion],"What do people think about remixes r/EDM?

Do you think that they are great for the genre, or particular remixes ruin the song for you?

Martin Garrix stated in an interview a little while back he didn't like most remixes as it was trying to recreate the song and as such it was destroying his memories of some songs he had used to love.

Personally, I believe we need remixes of songs for EDM to have its own identity, but I believe remixes where they change the genre dramatically need to stop. For example, a tropical house song should never be remixed to be a loud heavy hitting dubstep hit. Yes, maybe a chilled trap remix would be alright, but ruining the vibe of the song ruins the remix in my opinion.

So r/EDM, what are your thoughts on remixes?",EDM,1480514698,That_Guuuuuuuy,7,7,True,2016-11-30

I just discovered Electro-Swag today.  Can't get enough, it blows the shit out of House music or Dubstep or what have you in terms of sheer energy and momentum.  

So I went on YouTube and I found a few different Electro-Swag playlists, and there are some songs I like on there, but most are more old-styled and/or slower.  I like how Caravan Palace took the old sound and made it new, and made it fast and modern-sounding with the lyrics.  I don't like Electro-Swag that's basically 20s music with a modern drum beat and some crappy audio samples interlaced.

What are some other songs, not by Caravan Palace, that are fresh, fast, and have audio quality that sounds like it's not from almost 100 years ago, while still having that swingy feel from the raging 20s (unless I'm wrong about the decade this style originated from)?

I'm also still looking for EDM Christmas music.  Someone else suggested Mad Decent's album but it's way too hiphoppy.  But that's as an aside - I think Electro-Swag would compliment standard Christmas music well for the event I've got coming up.",EDM,1479962561,RewindRepeatIt,2,1,True,2016-11-23

How have you seen the American dance music audience grow and evolve since your rise to fame?


Absolutely, I mean I‚Äôve been doing this solid for 3 years now, and Ive done many festivals in America. And I think the kids, who were probably 18 at the time, are 21 now, and they are allowed to go to clubs. Which means they are able to discover a whole new world, with whole new sounds, with all of these amazing djs who are coming to the states from all over. And definitely, this is where the shift is beginning now, because these people are exposed to a different kind of sound and music. I mean, EDM, what does that mean? You know, it‚Äôs pop, trash, commercial, electro for the ‚Äú1 IQ‚Äù person out there, with a three note melody, like a Christmas carol ‚Äì c‚Äômon! Its just not clever at all! Its just so stupid.

Will gift reddit gold to whoever predicts the top DJ of 2016 according to DJ Mag (the list is being released now.)

If multiple people guess correctly, it will be the first person who got it.  


edit #1:  so many people are picking the same #1, benefiting those who were early so I'm going to tweak it a little bit.  We are going to be guessing the #1 AND the #2 DJ.  If someone gets both right, they win.  If not, the person who gets #1 right the earliest still wins.

 -Artists name was in all caps, I think their name something to do with COLD or ICE or something.

Might have had ""club"" or ""bass"" in the name, but I really can't recall.

All I can remember of it is:

1. The last song of one of the CDs is a live version of Whigfield - Saturday Night, sounded like a very large crowd.
2. There is a french song on it.
3. There was a song I listened to hundreds of times that had something to do with ""the last night on earth"" or something along those lines. It was a woman singing and had a fairly light feel to it. I believe the lyrics were along the idea of ""it's the last day/night on earth so let's be together."" Mainly I just want to find this song at this point, but the whole compilation would be great.

2. The sort by artist. More like sort by album artist. Sort by artist should include the songs that the artist had a part in. Say I want to look up all W&amp;W songs. Guess what I can't! Because songs like *Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike/W&amp;W - Arcade* only go under DVLM!

6270,Noob looking for a genre and recommendations.,"Hi reddit, I'm a total noob when it comes to electronic music and I'm not sure if this belongs here but let's try. 

I was never really into electronic music with a few exceptions like Jean-Michelle Jarre, Pink Floyd (yeah, I know they don't really belong to this genre, but they were one of the first to experiment with samplers, synths and such) and newer stuff like Digitalism and a few others I can't name right now because stoned [4] and I also like post-rock. I'm really into epic, spherical (is that the right word), dreamy, thought-stimulating kinda stuff.

So, a while ago my brother visits me and he asks me if I want to go to a club with him (I never really was in a club before). I agreed and we took some ecstasy (not for the first time). Then we went to the dance floor and it kicked in. The music was really intense, so psychedelic, while totally danceable with nice bass, beat and spherical (I don't know what else to call it), wavy, epic parts. I just stood there in awe with closed eyes, somewhere else and enjoyed the moment...

And now, a few weeks later, I really want to listen to some more! If you could recommend me some stuff and tell me how that genre is called, that'd be awesome!",EDM,1474482342,Pooptimist,8,3,True,2016-09-21

https://twitter.com/MartinGarrix/status/773291962984198144

Based on that, there's only a few possibilities:
- Martin is lying
- Hardwell is reclaiming his throne
- There's gonna be a completely new #1 we haven't seen 

Based on the information currently out, I would guess that Hardwell is winning again. Since he's playing after the #1, it would make sense that he wins and just starts his set at the 'special guest' slot and did a 2 hour set. However... this wouldn't make a whole lot of sense since Hardwell did no campaigning this year and the iPad brothers did. It would be fishy at best to suggest that Hardwell lost to them last year while campaigning and won this year with no campaign. Or maybe DJ Mag want to save face and just put DVLM 2nd (even if they had more votes than hardwell) to not look like fools again. Thoughts on this?

The only reliable info I saw was on their site bio and it only says their names and what album kicked them off.

I know that they're not main headliners but they've certainly made a name for themselves. So who are these guys? How did they meet? How long have they been around for?

6310,"Security at Nocturnal Wonderland, and my letter to Insomniac","This letter I wrote to insomniac is kind of long. I don't know if anyone out here on reddit will give a shit, and I am expecting a few salty replies. But hopefully some of you in the rave community will know where I'm coming from. I saw a lot of good people go down this weekend at Nocturnal, and it was sad. Unlike anything I've seen before. Anyway, here it goes:

To whoever at Insomniac might read this letter,

I've been attending Insomniac events for years, and I've never had any experience that has made me doubt that Insomniac truly values and respects its headliners‚Äîuntil I attended Nocturnal Wonderland for one day on Sunday, September 4th. In the Insomniac events I've attended, I've always felt that Insomniac has created a safe space, not only in regard to headliner's physical safety, but their sense of psychological safety as well‚Äîand with a general sense of care for the future of headliners following the festival's conclusion.

It's because I still want to believe that Insomniac holds these values true that I feel it is necessary to express the sour taste that this years security at Nocturnal Wonderland left in my mouth.

In all my years of attending electronic music events, I have never experienced such an invasive and truly uncomfortable search while entering the festival. For the first time ever at any event, the security guard asked for permission to ""tug"" on the middle front of my bra (which I was wearing beneath a full corset top). Because the underwire of my bra was concealed by the corset top, this woman literally reached inside my top to ""tug"" on my bra. I'm putting ""tug"" in quotations, because that is not what the security guard did at all. She reached down my top, fiercely yanked my bra, and then proceeded to both of her hands under the cups of my bra to furiously yank on the underwire there, definitely touching my body in the process. Did I pass through security? Of course I did, because I didn't have any contraband. Am I traumatized by some random woman groping me on my way into the event? No. But as I walked away and made my way into the event, it was with an extreme sense of discomfort, the unshakeable sense that the security guard had toed the line of infringing upon my physical rights, and the thought, ""What the hell was that about?"" echoing around in my mind.

Obviously this targeting of woman's bras and tops was standard with security at this festival. I've only attended a small fraction of the events Insomniac has to offer, but this absolutely the only security search that I would describe as truly invasive. And I'm not just talking about the women's experience either. I spoke to one guy who was asked to unbutton his pants by a sheriff deputy immediately after he passed the security check, just so the deputy could look down his pants. Another male friend talked about how the guard ran his hands along the inside waistband of his pants, instead of just firmly pressing along the outside like they have at past Insomniac events. And another female friend was asked to remove her insert bra padding, while another friend had a security guard stick her finger inside her bra the check the open space where a bra insert would go.

It seems to me that there was extreme political motivation behind this intense searching. It is no secret that the San Bernardino County supervisor has been pushing for a ban of raves at San Manuel Amphitheater. With a total of 428 arrests for the weekend, over twice as much as EDC 2016 for a festival half the size, it seems to me that security and the Sheriff's department was out for blood this year so they have strong documentation the next time the opportunity arises for them to attempt to ban Insomniac from holding events at San Manuel. On my way into the event I saw deputies joking around as they were arresting a crying girl, and overheard them laughing about how they were ‚Äúon track to beat‚Äù their numbers from the previous night‚Äîwhich, as I‚Äôm sure you know, they certainly did.

This was not about compassion. This was not about keeping headliners safe. This was a game fueled by politics, and the attitude from the sheriff‚Äôs department was one of cruel elation and spite. Another example of this is the stories I heard of people that tried to turn around to go back to the amnesty bins‚Äîwhich, where I entered, were nearly hidden by the cluster of people and lack of order, since the lines were building up so far back since everyone was getting essentially as close as you could get to a strip search with your clothes still on‚Äîand the sheriff‚Äôs department people stopped them from going back to the bins and brought them into custody. If it was about safety, why not let those people return a few feet back to the bins? Because it was obvious they had missed them, and only people with contraband would be attempting to reach the bins. Those people going back to dispose of their mistakes were just another number to the sheriff‚Äôs department. Not only that, every person was basically treated as guilty before proved ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù by an uncomfortable security check, and on top of that, it‚Äôs no secret that hundreds of people still passed through those gates with contraband.

I don‚Äôt know how much Insomniac had to do with hiring of security, the sheriff‚Äôs department, or anything else. Which is why I‚Äôm writing, because what was going on at Nocturnal Wonderland wasn‚Äôt consistent with events I‚Äôve attended in the past. I know Insomniac wants to make money and probably has a strong interest in working with the sheriff‚Äôs department to keep San Manuel as a venue. But after all the things I saw and heard this weekend‚Äîalong with the invasive search I received when I was completely innocent‚Äîit would take a lot to get me to attend again, and I‚Äôm certain I‚Äôm not the only one. And with 428 arrests, the victories in this war against Insomniac and raves in San Bernardino county are only going to grow larger.

What happened to a lot of young people this weekend was a shame, considering at EDC the number of misdemeanors was low because young people that likely made the biggest mistake of their life merely had their contraband confiscated and their festival ticket voided. Many people‚Äîparticularly when they‚Äôre young and foolish‚Äîhave made a potentially life-altering mistake, and Insomniac has always seemed consistent with giving second chances and keeping people safe both before and after the event. Why else would Ground Control approach people who are clearly on controlled substances only to make sure that they are safe and hydrated? Why not call the police on them? At this point, I would actually be pleased if the Sheriff‚Äôs department won their little war‚Äîbecause then maybe it could be taken to a venue where law enforcement isn‚Äôt on a total witch hunt for the sole purpose of using young people as a number for political leverage against Insomniac.

I doubt anyone that reads this is going to care. I highly doubt anything will change. But I‚Äôm adding my voice to the collective on the slim hope that someone out there still gives a damn.

TL;DR: San Bernardino County has wanted raves banned from San Manuel Amphitheater for some time. They conducted invasive searches last weekend and made a game out of how many people they could arrest, and security and the Sheriff's department was out for blood this year so they have strong documentation the next time the opportunity arises for them to attempt to ban Insomniac from holding events at San Manuel. The entire vibe was ""guilty until proven innocent"", and to be proved innocent was submitting to an search that was as invasive as they could get without asking you to remove your clothing. Amnesty bins were not visible through the cluster fuck of a line, since the line was so long because everyone was getting intensely searched, and people that attempted to go back to amnesty bins were taken into custody. In my opinion, a total witch hunt.",EDM,1473230275,oneravergirl,4,7,True,2016-09-06
6311,Kaskade's Redux sets.,"A lot of people don't understand that his Redux shows are not the regular EDM sets you see in festivals with the WUB-WUBS, big build-ups and drops. I like it cause its like just house music, clean and not so much distorted. When I see videos on YT in his Redux sets I kinda feel sad cause I can tell a lot of people are waiting for heavy drops and build-ups. Am I the only one who feels this way? He is having a Redux set in Brooklyn, NY pretty soon and I'm excited I'm going to see it.  ",EDM,1473233359,d4rkyouth,2,3,True,2016-09-07
6312,Looking for a band/video.,"Hi, hope this is the right place - if not just delete. I'm looking for a video by a band/duo who I believe to be IO, which could be wrong because I can't find it. 

The video centres on a female singer with a Japanese themed (or set in Japan) video with polaroid photos being taken of I believe of infidelity. There's allot of neon in it via CGI.

It was released I believe in the late 90s or early 2k's.

I get that everyone is entitled to an opinion, but you just don't see it a quarter as much for other artists as you do those two. I for one don't like Techno, that's just my opinion (how dare i have one of those I know), but i have never slated the music, the artists or the fans of it before. In a different post on r/edm right now about Garrix and the poll, people were quick to jump to give DV+LM shit, which I just don't get. They have an incredible amount of fans, as proven by selling 60.000 tickets in 60 minutes for their show at the end of the year. When they play ANY festival, it's ALWAYS rammed wall to wall with people. They put on a show, people love it, it works for some, doesn't for others. So why all the hate?

Basically once you get out of the wading pool of big-room house and dubstep, it gets confusing.

So anyway, recently I heard ""Round 1"" by Dex Arson.  I like it, I want more music like it, because I need more highly energetic tracks to get the crowd going.  Monstercat says that it's electro.  So I Googled ""electro artists"", and got bullshit results like David Guetta, Major Lazer, Skrillex, Hardwell, and Tiesto.  Not a single one of them is electro, Hardwell could be considered electro-house I suppose, but anyway.

So obviously Google is no help there.  So I head on over to /r/electro.  I ask them, and they tell me that Round 1 isn't electro, even though Monstercat says it is.  So I listened to a few of the tracks off the front page of their sub.  That's not what I'm looking for either.

So I'm completely lost, I have no fucking clue what is and isn't electro, I don't know whether to believe Monstercat saying the track is electro, or /r/electro saying it's not.  If it's not electro, the fuck is it?

Basically I just want more fast, thumping, energetic music like that song.  But I don't know where to look.  I don't believe it's DnB, I know it's not dubstep or brostep, I have no clue if it is or isn't electro, I'm lost.

My friend and I have been looking for this song for a little while. The bass drop sounds very similar to the one in Shotgun - Yellow Claw https://youtu.be/Kmj2tGZS7Ic?t=39s.

My friend thinks we heard Skrillex play this song but I'm not convinced. If it helps here is the lineup to Ile Soniq, the festival we most likely heard it at http://imgur.com/kACzhAa.

6387,The U.S. needs to embrace Hardstyle!,"So as a huge fan of Hardstyle, i've noticed that it is something that is not catching on here in the U.S. and i kind of wanted to get your opinion of why that is since this subreddit pertains to all genres of EDM.  
Down here in Tampa, where the EDM scene is pretty big, it is dominated by Trap and Dubstep taking over the clubs every weekend just like everywhere else in the country.  I get it though, it pertains to the younger crowds and most people like hip hop too, so it's a win win.  However, it just seems that the scene is being oversaturated with Trap and Dubstep and there is no variety.  As a fan of EDM, i would like to see other genres be given a chance, but most of all Hardstyle. No matter what mood i'm in, i can put some Hardstyle on and it instantly brings me joy.  It's the melodic and beautifully euphoric sounds that i just can't get enough of, and of course those kicks! I don't know why it's not accepted here in the states like it is overseas where it is widely popular and gaining even more in many countries in Europe and Australia, but we need to give it a chance!  I have been realizing more of the mainstream dj's are including Hardstyle in their sets because it really gets the crowd going including recently Hardwell, Carnage sometimes has a full set, and even Armin Van Buuren.  
I know that L.A. sometimes has some Hardstyle dj's perform, but it's far and few in between, and it seems to be the only place they perform other than EDCLV.
So once again i ask, what is it about Hardstyle that is not catching on here, or why do you not give it a chance?  Is it the 150bpm? The kicks? The melodies? Because i know we all love bass, and Hardstyle has some of the best hard hitting bass in your face around.

Here are just a few for you to enjoy :)

I haven't been to a live EDM show before, but just heard about [Lights All Night](http://www.lightsallnight.com/). I checked out the website and 2 things happened. One: I freaked out that so many of the producers I love are going to be so close to where I am and two: I saw the 18+ and was immediately pissed that I hadn't been born 2 months earlier.

Anyways, I was wondering how easy/hard/possible it is for a 17 year old to get in to an 18+ show? Do they scan IDs?

I've been listening to EDM for years now; but EDC:LV was my first real rave, or anything really. I'm hooked. Trying to be smart financially though and pick n' choose my raving wisely. I want the low down on a few of the people playing Saturday. [Here's a link to the schedule](https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13901427_954696724677235_5747425460345970011_n.jpg?oh=6a2c71bd6cae2294113766459754197b&amp;oe=585224EF)


Showtek is my #1 duo for me. The only reason I even looked at Imagine is because they weren't at EDC. By the looks of this I plan on hitting the Showtek - Adventure Club - Dillion Francis group of sets at the ""mainstage"". I'd like a good spot for Showtek so I'll catch a minimum of the last half of Cosmic Gate.

Outside of that; I'm open to exploring new things. I will only be there 1 day, so I want to get everything out of it I can. I plan to there from open to close. I love basically every genre of EDM there is, although house is my guilty pleasure. Can you guys give me some ideas on what to expect from the following people/questions? I've heard most of the names I'm about to list, but like 2-3 songs max.

Zeds Dead.  Cosmic Gate. Keys N Krates. Funtcase B2B Cookie Monsta. Cazzette. Aphrodite. The Disco Biscuits.

I would like to see Doctor P, as he was one of the first I ever listened to, but I'm not hell bent on it. Basically, I'm looking for advice on what to see outside of my 3 ""locked-in"" sets, especially early in the day. After Dillon Francis, should I just dip and go see The Disco Biscuits? Or stay for Zeds Dead?

I searched through like all recent Heldeep Radio podcasts (cuz Oliver loves to play some massive tracks from Tchami in there), all tracks on Tchami's label CONFESSION and of course through all his previous sets from recent months. Still, didn't find the track name. 
I recorded 30 second video from Tchami's set on Sunrise and it contains the song I'm talking about. Please, reddit, help me!

And here's the link to the song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPhxG38UFIA",EDM,1470225816,Rasgulus,4,2,True,2016-08-03

Tropical House?

It has an unmistakable hook: Starts with very prominent, high-pitched steel drums and women's vocals singing ""yeah"" or something in the background

Very upbeat and just screams sunshine on the beach.

6460,What genres/Artists would you recommend to someone coming from classical music?,"I'm very into classical music, and I myself am a musician.

Recently I've had this desire to get into EDM/House music, especially for my workouts.  But all the different genres are extremely confusing to me.  I love the energy and feelings of some of this EDM music, but much of what I've heard bores me very quickly.  I'm not out on a dance floor, so I'd like to combine that energy of the music with the beauty/complexity/harmony of Classical/jazz.  

**What I want:**  Music that is interesting from a melodic/harmonic perspective and not just rhythm.  The complexity and beauty of JS Bach is what keeps me from being bored after 100 listens.  Preferably songs which have vocals, or else really interesting melodies from weird instruments.  LOTS of changes throughout the song.  (Heavy/soft, rhythm/melody, fast/slow)


**What I don't want:**  Extremely repetitive intros consisting of just beats and percussion for 4 measures, and then another 4 measures of the same thing *slightly altered*, then another 4 measures etc etc.

Here's a few songs I've found that I enjoy:

Mike Posner - I took a pill in Ibiza

Nervo - Reason

Reid Speed - Instant replay

6464,Easing into Anxiety-Free EDM. Help needed.,"I hope nobody takes offense to this statement:

**I cannot stand EDM**

Before you get too defensive, please let me explain. I am not saying this to troll a subreddit dedicated to a music genre that I am not fond of to make any judgements against anybody else. So let me explain.

I never listened to EDM and last year I became great friends with and then started seeing this girl who has grown to become the love of my life. We have so many things in common, but one of those things is not EDM music. She finds it relaxing and comforting and I get very bad anxiety from it. It's not that I don't want to like it; I actually do. There's something about the sounds and the irregular rhythm that speeds my heart up and causes me to have really bad anxiety. My old therapist said he has heard of this and that it likely comes from my mind trying to fill in the next sounds based on what would be expected in other forms of popular music, but the unexpectedness of the sounds and beat can cause anxiety.

For nearly a year we have had an arrangement where she listens to A State of Trance and other EDM podcasts and things when I'm not around so she can listen to it and I don't have to. The problem with that it is an important part of her and who she is, and I want to learn to be able to at least tolerate a type of music she likes very much.

I had a thought that maybe there might be a less anxiety provoking form of EDM I could start listening to with her and try to slowly work my way to being able to handle more and more intense forms of the music so that she can listen to it and I can enjoy my time with her while it's happening.

Any pointers on this? I'm sorry if this is a very strange question, I just didn't know where else I might be able to find help with this. Thanks.",EDM,1469691900,travis_ahimsa,72,10,True,2016-07-28

I was listening to Spotify this morning and on came Disclosure's remix of Jesse Ware's ""Running"" ([Beatport Link](https://www.beatport.com/track/running-disclosure-remix/3769197)). Since I have a Google Play Music subscription, I used the app on my phone to identify the song to quickly add to a playlist on Google Play Music. 

The song was identified by Google as ""Running by Banksy"", and not ""Running (Disclosure Remix) by Jesse Ware"". So it got me curious. 

I listened to the song it was **exactly the same track**. It got me furious thinking that this DJ Banksy guy was making money off of Disclosure and Jesse Ware's song. I did some Googling and the guy is even[ selling the song through his Bandcamp](https://banksydj.bandcamp.com/track/running-original-mix) as an original Deep House track. I'm sure he's tried to rip off more big artists as well.

6542,Be aware: Content theft exists among producers,"This morning, a friend and I found out that a producer from Leicester, UK who goes by the name of SKORTIX has been stealing my friends' (note, plural) music, re-uploading it to his Bandcamp as his own work. 
Now my friends, DimasEDM and TheoMartel, are both very hardworking producers, especially the former. This is why it absolutely pisses me off that somebody would have the nerve to copy an entire EP and upload it under their own name, and even changing some of the song titles! I will be linking BUT SOME OF THE CONTENT which was stolen from DimasEDM and others by Skortix and uploaded to his /supposed/ Crystal Cave EP. Most of this is from DimasEDM's Ikigai EP. If you will look it up, you will definitely see it for yourself.

This is a video of a teaser shot by Dimas of his collaboration with M.C. DZ. You may notice that Skortix will NEVER release the full version, because the full version literally has a shout-out to Dimas in the lyrics. I'm not sure if the video is still up, since when I click the link, it comes up unavailable, but it is VERY possible that Skortix blocked my personal account.

Again, these are only a few of the tracks which were stolen. You may be asking, why am I posting this? Is it to ruin Skortix's name? Is it out of frustration that such a thing still happens in this day and age? I can't lie about this, I am absolutely, positively irritated by what Skortix has done, but beyond this, I would like to spread awareness that this happens. Any artist, be it a writer, a painter, or even musician would agree that having your work and credit for your work stolen from you - for lack of a better set of words - totally freaking sucks. It's not right, it shouldn't still be happening, and I've seen Dimas working personally. He is literally the hardest working person I've ever seen, and the last thing he deserves is some prick who thinks he can just steal what Dimas works so hard for. Why don't I just file a copyright complaint? Well, I have. I sent a copyright complaint with similar information to Bandcamp, but I already know by this point that we can't always count on an e-mail address on the internet to fix these things, so I'm counting on anyone reading this to be aware that Skortix is not the producer he claims to be.

If anyone knows Skortix, or has a means to directly contact him, be the good friend he needs and make him realize that what he's doing is wrong. It is poison to art, please knock some sense in to him to get him to realize that this isn't what will make him a world-famous producer, if that's what he's after. 
Skortix, if you are reading this, you should be ashamed of yourself. I pray nobody ever takes what you spend hours creating and bastardizes it like what you have done to us, IF you even have any original work of your own.",EDM,1467904433,kittXkat,6,21,True,2016-07-07

6544,"PSA: Your mP3 of ""Faded - ZHU"" is (Probably?) too slow","I recently discovered that like 95% of the versions of this song available on - ahem - *disreputable distributors* are at 118 bpm when the actual song is supposed to be at 125.

You can check the BPM of your file [using this tool](http://www.all8.com/tools/bpm.htm) to tap out the beat.

I know it's not that uncommon for questionably acquired songs to be altered in some way; I'm only sharing this because I've never seen an instance of almost every single available source being wrong in the same, unusual way. Especially for such a popular track that received so many different releases. I actually suspect that 118 bpm file may have been some kind of demo? Or a plant by ZHU to trip people up? Either way, it's been so widely circulated at this point that it's much harder to find the actual version of the track than it is to find this slower one.

I asked my friend a bit and he recommended **DVBBS**, **Hardwell** (he has end show). I also know **David Guetta** (saw his set online in Paris for Euro 2016 and it was great),**Afrojack** (I really like 10ft tall, Sparks), **Nicky Romero** and **Zedd** (looking forward to this one as well). I know **Vinai** a bit too.

So, any input, insight and your opinion on this is much appreciated (you can share your experience from their shows, I'd definitely like that). I don't really care if they are ""commercial"" or something similar, as long as you think their set should be fun :)

edit::

My thoughts and contributions.

I'm not a fan of Garrix, Aoki and Cedric Gervais.

All 3 produce nothin' special in my opinion.

Garrix and Aoki have some controversy that is against my code of producer ethics, which is pirating plugins. To me pirating a 200 dollar software is almost like stealing a synth from Guitar Center. Programers work hard to create things like this for us. However, I do tend to tolerate those introductory artists that pirate a synth all because they're low on money, they're just getting their feet wet with producing, and maybe in the future they'll by it. But Aoki and Garrix, were caught red handed still using pirated software AFTER their fame and money came in.

As for Gervais. He's very boring. And all his ONE HIT SINGLES! have nothing new to offer when they come out. That's another thing, He's one of those artists that just release singles, and most of them are just remixes. Not that I don't like remixes. But why only singles? It feels like he spends his time doing other things then actually creating music. Artists like Daedalus have thousands of songs and albums, because they like to produce their art.",EDM,1466110673,zmoney18,19,0,True,2016-06-16

I can't vividly remember the build, but right be for the drop you hear ""Here we go!"" from what seems like either an anime character or a video game character, and then comes the dubstep which as I mentioned resembles something Doctor P might cook up.

Looking at their new shows, they seem to be playing all great Dutch DJs in the next few weeks, all of which are in the top 36 on DJ mag. Now I'm trying to decide which one(s) to see:

* Blasterjaxx - May 22nd ($45)
* Oliver Heldens - June 11 ($60)
* Ummet Ozcan - June 17 ($32)
* W&amp;W - June 18 ($45)

Never seen any of these guys live, and I dont think I can see them all. I do plan on going to Ultra Miami 2017 and I would assume most of these guys would be there too, but if they're good...I would probably want to see them again, haha.

My music preference is usually Electro-House, though it tends to vary, and I usually gravitate towards DJs from the Netherlands...but that doesnt narrow down any of these guys, haha. Basically, as long as its great to dance to, I'm going to like it.

W&amp;W play out a version which sounds a lot less tight in the mixdown, the synths have a much longer release, and the low end/kick doesn't feel as bouncy. Hardwell by contrast plays out a version that has a slight break melody change just before the build, and it sounds a lot tighter. It seems to me W&amp;W still play out the version from 2013, but Hardwell plays an updated version of the track that got debuted at Ultra 2015. Anyone have any idea why W&amp;W might still be playing the older version? (that sounds a lot less clean and more like a demo).

Okay. What exactly does 4 on the floor beat mean? And I try to listen to that ""kick hat snare hat kick hat snare hat"" and I can't hear it. I definitely don't have knowledge on music theory so maybe that's why?

Also, take this for example. http://soundcloud.com/karmafields/karma-fields-build-the-cities-feat-kerli-ac-slater-remix I read somewhere that it's bass house, which can be classified as deep house and dubstep together. But if I was to hear this, I'd automatically just assume it's dubstep due to the wobble I hear.

What this does is it allow people to search this subreddit for EDM from a certain year. If anybody is looking for music from 2010, then they would type ""[2010]"" in the search bar and limit the search to /r/EDM.

Now my view on this is obviously anecdotal, but what I've come to notice these past few years is that many people, including friends of mine who are relatively new to EDM, all love House, Progressive House, Big Room House, and so on, but refuse to even give trance a shot. 

To me, trance defined modern EDM, I kind of view it as the ""original"" even if that isn't necessarily 100% accurate. Most of the biggest forms of EDM wouldn't even really exist without it, hell, progressive house borrows so heavily from trance that it could arguably be viewed as just a modern evolution of it. 

I know a lot of people say trance is ""niche,"" but so much of modern EDM just borrows from it. Everything from the vocalists, the progression of the beat, and the drops. Since so many of the main-stream-popular-genres are influenced by it, why does it seem like it's such an under-appreciated genre?  ",EDM,1461147370,neonturkey,41,34,True,2016-04-20

My favorite songs are the ones with great female vocals, for some reason it just compliments the song well for me.

Top songs for me range from pop-ish songs like:

Zedd - I Want You to Know

Cash Cash - Surrender

Tim Berg/Avicii - Seek Bromance

To things like:

Yellow Claw - Til it Hurts

Alison Wonderland - I Want U. 

Does anyone happen to have any good recommendations for songs similiar to these? I am willing to explore things that are vaguely similiar as well.

Lots of these choices came from this thread from over a year ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/EDM/comments/2qjzgn/my_favorite_edm_tracks_are_those_that_feature/

It starts off with this kind of southafrican shout/jazz trumpet pitching up , it then fades into the ""drop"" which has a very strong kick , percussions in the background , and  a very wide future house kind of sound , the melody is very funky and jazzy.

Then theres the breakdown , after that there's a trap/breakbeat part and then it ends.

As you can read in that article, the other musicians say that The Chainsmokers were selling out, etc. According to Porter Robinson, The Chainsmokers even admitted to making the song just to make money off it. How? Why was it cheap to make that song? Did they ""know"" that it was going to be a hit? Did their label tell them to do a song about a relevant topic that's easy to make fun of, and by doing the song they sold out? Or is the song's structure simply too simple or anything?

Now, I'm not defending or attacking The Chainsmokers. I'm genuinely wondering. I'm relatively new to the EDM scene and interested in why this particular song got so much hate. The first time I heard it, I just thought it was a spot-on parody of people obsessing over social media (especially selfies, obviously).

By the way, if The Chainsmokers lost any respect by releasing #Selfie, did they gain anything back by the release of ""Roses""?

Welcome back to the ""New EDM"" thread! A new post will replace this one every Tuesday morning.

I made this thread hoping that we all could share our favorite new tracks and at the same time be civil with one another.

The ground rules:

* All submissions (songs, remixes, podcasts/mixes) must be **3 months old or newer** - the **ONLY** exception to this rule is say for example a remix of an older song is released (but the remix itself needs to be 3 months old or newer)
* You are **ENCOURAGED** to post multiple submissions whether it be all at once or in multiple posts throughout the week.

My first of many submissions this week:

* Electro House
* Complextro
* Future bass
* Chill

For the last couple of days I have a song in my head and I've been unable to find it since. The song is progressive house with a male vocal and I can only remember some text from the chorus.

Some of the lyrics:

""For you"" (said multiple times, I figured it was the song title, but no)

""I'll be the one that takes the fall"" (after ""for you"")

""I'll be the one that risks it all"" (also after ""for you"")

Personally when I think of the song I remember it being a song on the Enhanced label but that's just a guess. The drop happens after singing ""For you"".

I tried to Google it like every other song but so many songs have the text ""for you"" that I just couldn't find it and I have to resort to asking others. Please help me find it it would mean a lot to me and I won't bother the subreddit again hehe.

Over a year ago [I made a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDM/comments/2nedlk/this_guy_steals_music_and_posts_it_as_his_own/) where I found [this guy ""FWS""](https://soundcloud.com/officialfws) had stolen a remix of mine and posted it as his own. We later found that more tracks on his page were stolen and he eventually ""Removed"" all his content (thanks to you guys bombarding his soundcloud). In light of the ""SoFlo Antonio"" drama thats been happening on reddit, I decided to check out his soundcloud to see if he was still up to his dirty business. Turns out his soundcloud is still up and he has a bunch of stolen tracks on it still. 

The tracks have attained quite a number of plays (in the hundreds of thousands). While I know a ton of them are not real, there's a good chance that many of the plays are real due to the ""publicity"" he gets from his fake plays.

 He posted [this](https://www.facebook.com/FreeWorldSeppie/photos/a.130237000502425.1073741828.123446134514845/451397708386351/?type=3&amp;theater) on facebook the other day celebrating being #25 on the soundcloud charts. 

I ask your help to help defeat FWS and have his soundcloud page removed once and for all. 

**I was able to find the originals of the following songs:**

[Stolen Austronaut - RAIN remix](https://soundcloud.com/officialfws/rain-fws-remix)   ---------     [Original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lSy0aqfta4) //removed

[Stolen Paris Bolm - Colors remix](https://soundcloud.com/officialfws/colorfws-remix) -------- [Original](https://soundcloud.com/raider/tritonal-paris-blohm-ft) //removed

 I haven't been able to find others yet as he may have stolen them from small artists (like myself) and they may be difficult to find.
If you are able to find any that I have not found or recognize any songs on his page as someone else's, comment below and i will add to this list.


**EDIT:**

**I also suspect his new song [""I Spy""](https://soundcloud.com/officialfws/i-spy1) is stolen. It is at almost a MILLION views right now**
//removed

**EDIT2:**

**It looks like he ""removed"" the two songs posted above.**

 probably saw this post and took them down. please keep on the lookout for other songs he may have stolen, thanks!

**EDIT3**

**Apperently he knows how to throw down a pretty good rager...** http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/wilmette/crime/ct-wml-big-prairke-ave-party-tl-0709-20150406-story.html

**MESSAGE TO FWS**

""You are such a fake... I would say you're whats wrong with the music industry but I would be wrong because you'll never make it in the industry..... The moment you get a little more famous off the plagiarised music you stole from real producers you'll get requests to collaborate. You'll get people asking for stems, you'll get people asking for Ableton or Logic sessions. And also, you're all over Reddit and Facebook. But, you could always delete your account, actually learn how to produce (or get better at producing), stop stealing peoples music and re-invent yourself. You haven't reached the point of no return. Think about it mate. Have a good one dude.""

7024,What are your LEAST three favorite genres of EDM?,"1. Hardstyle. I grew up playing the drums and piano and have lots of love for various ""rock/metal"" genres but could never get into superfast kicks and highhats going the WHOLE time. I feel hard style is the same thing in the EDM world. 

2. Deep house. Theres nothing wrong with it, i just am never in the mood to listen unless im going to bed. 

3. Techno. Similar to hardstyle. I guess you can say techno is what originally brought me into the edm world but i cringe when i hear most of it now. ",EDM,1455129967,Bud_Johnson,12,5,True,2016-02-10

One I've been hearing is that is that a lot of EDM artists, even pros, never actually record their music from an instrument or controller, but instead buy sample packs and VSTs, and sit down and draw in everything in their sequence. That's why edm music sounds very quantized and perfectly on beat.

Is this actually a common practice in EDM? There's nothing wrong with buying royalty free drum loops and samples right? I mean that's what they're made for.",EDM,1455228485,zmoney18,4,1,True,2016-02-11
7040,The identity of Grey!,"So I found this out like two weeks ago and several of you probably know, but there's a multitude of clueless sentients out there that remains unaware, so to meet their curiosity with open arms, here you are.

Affirming the theory echoed by fans for several months now, Grey is indeed a duo of brothers Kyle (aka Singularity, now Kyle Tree) and Michael Trewartha (who used to [produce](http://play.beatport.com/contests/sander-van-doorn-martin-garrix-dvbbs-gold-skies-feat-aleesia/53cdf92f753a0d1acd52fd84) under the alias ""SIRIS"", whose SoundCloud profile is now dead). Here's the list of evidence.

- [This is Michael's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/michaeltrewartha/). It contains [several](https://www.instagram.com/p/0tWZxXoYHd/?taken-by=michaeltrewartha) [pictures](https://www.instagram.com/p/1OigFPoYMd/?taken-by=michaeltrewartha) [of](https://www.instagram.com/p/wUxBqBoYBl/?taken-by=michaeltrewartha) him taken from a photoshoot done on an LA rooftop. [Here is a video for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-81AEWuC3M8). [THIS RIGHT HERE](https://www.facebook.com/greymusique/photos/pb.1607465132851246.-2207520000.1455230727./1607468466184246/?type=3&amp;theater) is Grey's banner picture on their social media platforms, and low and behold, that man is Mr. Trewartha.

- Michael is indeed Kyle's brother. [Here's a childhood photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/NkTDqlIYNS/?taken-by=michaeltrewartha) of the boys on Michael's Instagram. He's also referenced Kyle in numerous posts in the past, and [this article about Singularity](http://www.ocweekly.com/music/singularity-highlights-the-m-in-edm-6423721) credits Michael as Kyle's official photographer.

- Why does it matter that they are brothers? Because [YourEDM](http://www.youredm.com/2015/12/28/into-the-wav-how-prodigious-duo-grey-raised-a-brow-from-zedd-skrillex/) confirmed that Grey is a duo of brothers. It's bolded on line 8 of that interview.

- Recent evidence from this month includes [this photo of Michael](https://www.facebook.com/greymusique/photos/a.1632662763664816.1073741828.1607465132851246/1669823009948791/?type=3&amp;theater) that Grey just posted today, and [Zedd Tweeted a picture](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CacGoEhVAAEgzZS.jpg:large) of himself with several friends at the XLanes bowling alley in LA. The Trewartha brothers are present and Grey retweeted the pic.

- [Grey uses Ableton](https://twitter.com/greymusique/status/682307847607205888), and [so do Michael](https://www.instagram.com/p/c0UNTlIYFj/?taken-by=michaeltrewartha) (remix of Calvin Harris - I Need Your Love, not sure if released or not) [and Singularity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIWfhgBkp40). Some Reddit users who knew that Singularity had a producer brother mentioned that it has to do with Grey as well but they're keeping quiet.

- Singularity has been [reposting all of Grey's remixes](https://soundcloud.com/singularity) on his SoundCloud, and also [retweets things about them a lot](http://imgur.com/a/eKsBy). If you see that Imgur album, you'll notice that Singularity is one of Grey's earliest followers (followed around June), and Grey released their Beautiful Now remix only at the end of July.

- Singularity has also been saying very Grey-ish things like [""major is the new minor""](https://twitter.com/ImSingularity/status/639931529158758400) (Grey's remixes have a tendency to really switch up minor chords into major chords for that Egyptian vibe, mainly in the Disarm You and Beautiful Now remixes), and has [expressed a desire to release music independently](https://twitter.com/ImSingularity/status/619781257195450368) (Grey started off on their own and only got signed to Interscope a month after the Papercut remix). He's also [an admirer of Zedd](https://twitter.com/ImSingularity/status/601117282484400128) just like Grey, specifically for the unique chord progressions he's brought to the mainstream world (just go listen to the chords in one of Grey's remixes, the progressions are brilliant).

- Both Kyle and Michael live in LA like Grey does.

- Someone on /r/EDM said they were friends with half of Grey. They didn't explicitly say who it was, but said that this guy is an alumnus of Insomniac's [""EDC Discovery Project""](https://www.insomniac.com/discovery/alumni) to boost the careers of up and coming producers. Low and behold, [Singularity is part of that list](https://www.insomniac.com/content/singularity). It's a bit of an outdated bio but also affirms that he uses Ableton.

That's all the concrete evidence, but if you go listen to Singularity's music, there are a bunch of similarities there too.

- Singularity and [GetYourSnackOn](https://soundcloud.com/getyoursnackon), who is known for frighteningly accurate EDM remakes, co-own [Singular Sounds](https://soundcloud.com/singularsounds) through which they release sample packs. I have the future bass one and it has a lot of Grey-like percussive elements and bass patches. I don't use Sylenth1 but a Reddit user who does says that there's a synth patch in there which was literally reused in the Papercut remix without any major modifications.

- Singularity happens to use the [same vocoder](https://youtu.be/PGk-dVHKj1o?t=27s) as [Grey did in their first remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdCrG13ATh0).

- Singularity uses a [similar-sounding guitar](https://youtu.be/ZRP3bJPkF_Y?t=1m23s) in his music. Under his new public alias ""Kyle Tree"" he made [this tropical house remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ_uwXmYy5Q) for pop singer Mike Posner. If you listen closely, the little funky bass patch is the same as [the one Grey used](https://youtu.be/KI7miqBMUfw?t=19s) for their Selena Gomez remix. Also in ""Rift"", if you listen to the full song (it's great!!), there's that slidy synth lead before the guitar portion which Grey uses very subtly in some portions. The drop of the Beautiful Now remix might actually even use the same patch but just over really high notes.

Seeing as Grey posted a picture of Michael and retweeted the Zedd pic, I guess they're planning on revealing themselves soon, but all the proof is lying around already. I spent a bit too much time researching this shit but oh well.

EDIT: Oh and Grey [tweeted this pic](https://twitter.com/greymusique/status/693511236579766272) a while back of them going skiing with Scout. Guy in the front is wearing a shirt for [Avis√© Apparel](https://aviseapparel.com/v1/), which Michael I think still works for, and if you look at his eyes closely that too tells you it's Michael. The Avise site has the exact picture that Grey uses on the banner. Grey just edited out the Avise logo and changed up the lighting in the pic, and then put up a mirror image

EDIT 2: Michael Burk, a personal friend of the brothers, Tweeted [this video](https://twitter.com/_MichaelBurk/status/705274494244360192), captioned ""dope hangs with @scoutla @greymusique"". ""@scoutla"" is Scout, obviously, but as you can see, the brothers are front and center. The guy that Singularity is hiding behind is Tom Norris aka GetYourSnackOn.

EDIT 3: I believe their secrecy is officially destroyed with [this group selfie](https://twitter.com/Zedd/status/712757520025018368) Zedd Tweeted today (Grey retweeted it). Now I wonder who those handsome young lads on the left are...",EDM,1455231670,TheTruckWashChannel,16,7,True,2016-02-11

-Differences between future house, bass house, g-house, deep house. What does one of these does Jauz - Rock the Party fall under? I always labeled it as future house until somebody had me questioning it today.

Hey, I've had this passion for EDM since I was in my scene phase in middle school. (7th grade) The first person I ever heard was skrillex, almost everyone's 1st, and I fell deeply in love with this new genre that seemed to come out of nowhere for me. Ever since that day I've wanted to become a DJ but, now that I think about it. How do I become a DJ withought actually knowing anything about turntables, production software, when to change up the beat etc? I'm now 16, a junior in highschool (11th grade) and if I have a dream career, I should probably start soon before my highschool days are over. Finally started trying to get a small taste of what it's like and try it out. I thought the best place to go is reddit or youtube. 

My questions: 
‚Ä¢ What programs do I use to begin with?

‚Ä¢ Do I need to spent alot of money on equipment to make music?

‚Ä¢ How do I mix beats with different BPMs and make my own beats?

I can't pinpoint exactly what it is I like about the song, but it does remind me of Avicci's Hey Brother, so perhaps it's just the alternation between awesome vocals and a more laid back beat.

I'm trying to find a genre, artists, or even songs similar to this song. The song is Icarus by Madeon (I'll link it) and I'm really just wanting anything that is similar. I've listened to a couple more of his tracks and nothing seems as capturing as this one. I am currently listening to a playlist on Spotify that's kind of like it. The genres in it are Nu Disco, Indie Dance, and Indie Electro. Anything would be appreciated. And thanks for taking the time out to read my post.

7146,Planning to run an EDM promotion channel. Any tips or advices?,"Hi! I'm a guy from South Korea who's interested in running a music promotion channel, mostly dedicated to EDM. IMO, a lot of talented producers in my country are mostly unnoticed and forgotten. They *want* to make music for a living, or maybe just for fun, but they simply can't because they get almost nothing from it. The audience pool is slowly growing, but there aren't any big communities or websites related to EDM in South Korea. Maybe a few blogs, but nothing more than that.

That's why I'm planning on building a Youtube channel which producers, including Koreans who cannot write in English, can submit their music and show it to the audience around the world. Of course, the channel will be completely in English, so there won't be any confusion for non-Korean producers and audience. I'm planning on running the channel exactly the same as how other promoters manage their channels, but having the whole Korean producers on my side will give me a great deal of advantage.

So are there any useful tips or advices that I can keep in mind? I also noticed a Multi-Channel Network called edmDistrict(not sure if it's an MCN or not, but it does seem like one). Would working with them be a great chance? Thanks!",EDM,1452090582,Pentaleaf,12,1,True,2016-01-06

Tomorrow I'm going to my first infected mushroom show with my buddy. I was wondering, what would be  proper attire for an infected mushroom show? I have my typical ""rave"" attire and beads, but I feel like because of the style of the music, infected mushroom might not be the same attire?

7274,"I get massive migraines, and sometimes mellow music helps. Who can I listen to?","I'm new to the EDM scene.  Well, at least knowing EDM was a thing. 

I've liked some Daft Punk for a while.   I like Ellie Goulding, a bit of Skrillex(mostly Bangarang and anything with Korn), some Krewella, and some others.  As you can tell, I like stuff with singing.  I'm not a huge fan of music without lyrics.

I occasionally get massive migraines and sometimes mellow music helps.  I like to listen to Lorde, Fences, Of Monsters and Men, Tove Lo, Jack Johnson, Lindsay Stirling, and Mary Lambert to calm my head down. 

I don't want to listen to anything too loud, or heavy, just some mellow stuff with a catchy beat.   From what I've read about EDM, House would be good for me.  But I really don't know where to start.  I figure if I start with some mellow artists, I could eventually build up to heavier or faster music. 

Anything would be great, thank you. 

Edit:  Ok, I just want to say that everyone here is awesome.  I have yet to make it through all of the music suggested, but this is an awesome list, and I cannot wait to listen to it all.

7276,Looking for a specific subgenre of trap?,"EDIT: I've checked out things such as down-tempo/""heaven"" trap and future bass, both of which are close but always have a little variation.

Hello,

I've been on a hunt for more songs that fall in a specific subcategory of trap (at least, as far as I can tell.) Some of the defining songs include:

[Jetta - I'd Love to Change the World \(Matstubs Remix\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hEh9LiSzow)

[Black Coast - TRNDSTTR \(Lucian Remix\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7Ve8ExE8YY)

[Draper - On You \(feat. Alby Hobbs\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aQfdExvHpc) 

[Galantis - Runaway \(U &amp; I\) - Yacht Club Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQtQXEHmfTM)

[Daktyl - Stay \(feat. Dive Deep\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czy09-N-knU)

[Lorde - Tennis Court \(Flume Remix\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ATu1BiOPZA)

Some patterns I notice include kind of down-tempo beats paired with significant, abstract, trappy drops. Most of the songs are more dreamy than the usual grimy trap sound. Also, vocals are something I obviously enjoy but are not necessary.

But let me preface by saying that this wouldn't be my first time seeing them either, however because my two previous times seeing them live were so different from each other, I'm conflicted and unsure whether I should go see them again.

My first time at their show, about 2 years ago, I left extremely underwhelmed. Music was great, but what sucked all the energy out of the show, was their obvious pandering to ""deep emo type kids"". For like 30 minutes they were giving some speech about the universe, and blah.. blah.. blah.. PLUR and all that jazz. 
I understand that some people may like that, but it is personally not for me. 

My second time at their show was at EDC LV this past June. And holy shit was it amazing. It's like, all the emotional bullshit was drastically cut, and it was just some really great music with minimal interruption. Bryan Cranston pushing the button was the highlight of the entire 3 day EDC weekend. 

If it makes any difference, the concert will be held at the same venue when I saw them the first time. Plus I'm unsure if it is just going to be a short set. So far they haven't announced any other artists that will be with them.

7501,"The Weekly ""New EDM"" Thread - Week of September 23, 2015","Sorry for being late with this week's thread, I was really busy yesterday.

Welcome back to the ""New EDM"" thread! A new post will replace this one every Tuesday morning.

I made this thread hoping that we all could share our favorite new tracks and at the same time be civil with one another.

The ground rules:

* All submissions (songs, remixes, podcasts/mixes) must be **3 months old or newer** - the **ONLY** exception to this rule is say for example a remix of an older song is released (but the remix itself needs to be 3 months old or newer)
* You are **ENCOURAGED** to post multiple submissions whether it be all at once or in multiple posts throughout the week.

My first of many submissions this week: 

**[Vicetone &amp; KSHMR - Phoenix (Unreleased)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98i8-FpyIjI)**

As always, a shameless plug for my current Spotify playlist AND my **new weekly mixes** that I am trying to get featured. Mostly new stuff I find with my all-time favorites mixed in:

**[EDM Megamix 2015](http://open.spotify.com/user/sativasam/playlist/73q0SfT20NdeGrwBN6UO5w)**

**My Best:** I have a tie, sorry I can't choose just one because KSHMR and W&amp;W are killing it this year. Yes I know KSHMR still hasn't done a show yet but it's coming soon. Whether it be Dead Man's Hand, his remix of It Feels, or whatever other banger he's made, he's so exciting to me because he's still so new to EDM and I truly think the sky is the limit for him.

W&amp;W put on some of the best shows you'll ever see. Their remix of Where Are U Now has one of the BEST big room drops I've ever heard in my life. Rave After Rave still gets me pumped up to go do something big and it has been out for over 6 months. 

**My Worst:** Nicky Romero - Now, don't get me wrong, Warriors was a catchy song, but have you heard Lighthouse? That song embodies every thing that I've hated about Nicky lately. You can tell how complacent he is in his career and is now making songs literally ANY DJ could be making.

7592,"[News] Martin Garrix Leaves Spinnin and Musicallstars Management, his statement inside:","NEWS

Due to rumours in the music industry I think it is necessary to inform everyone as follows.

It is correct that I recently nullified/terminated my agreements with MusicAllstars Management B.V. and Spinnin Records B.V.
There was a difference of opinion between us regarding the reasonableness of the agreements. Although I enjoyed working with the Spinnin and MAS team, it was not possible to bridge our different views with MusicAllstars Management B.V. and Spinnin Records B.V. 

From the beginning of this year I tried to get back the ownership rights of my music from Spinnin Records and to keep my confidence in MAS. I am extremely disappointed that the discussions have not led to a change in the agreements or return of the ownership rights, and that is why I nullified them. 
With that, I close this chapter. I trust that everyone respects that I would like to leave this behind me and that I prefer not to discuss this any further.

I am working on new tracks and have an exciting new project so hopefully I can share good news with you during Amsterdam Dance Event.

Thanks so much for all your amazing support and hope to see you soon! :)

There are three stages so some good artists play at the same time as others, like Deathmau5 and Dj Snake. I'm actually wondering which one would offer the best memorable experience.

Also what's your opinion about the other artists, which ones should I go see and why ?",EDM,1439448962,Beerbossa,5,1,True,2015-08-12

Never had music as a hobby, embarrassed as fuck,would like some solid advice.","I am very new to EDM, and to tell the truth, I have never had my own album that I would play in the car or listen to with people. I have never had music as a hobby, and even though I am older now I realize this is something I need to build on. Its weird that I cannot contribute to music or listen or have opinions on it when I talk with people. This girl was asking around what is your favorite song in the world and I was glad she didn't pick me since I would not know a thing to say. After that, I realize I need to build music, and I do like certain music, such as genres in EDM and rap music. My problem was I never knew where should I go to look for to build my album, and I am asking around here hoping if I someone can help me.

-I believe if I don't get into this and start building now I won't have time to develop my music hobby. Sounds weird, and I wish I didn't have to ask around.

To give a better idea on what types of songs I like:

- Shredz workout at soundcloud, this is a mix of theirs in youtube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvUnlqxbAW0

I dont like the entire mix but I do like the rap song+EDM that starts around 5:09

- Rectified at soundcloud, its a mix of EDM and rap music and I like the flow of it. I got the link from here.

- Then there is Aston Martin music that I like, but that is pretty old rap song.

What should I look for or can anyone give me songs that are EDM, rap, EDM+rap, etc.? Then there is Skrillex I like, but only a few songs. I hate to say but some EDM songs sound unmanly but then there are others that are very cool. 

Any advice would help guys. Please feel free to ask.

Edit: I am looking for songs that I can use at workouts, chilling out, in my car/driving, night/day, going out, or with someone. Any of those advice will help a lot.",EDM,1438796005,miclol,50,1,True,2015-08-05

Anyway, what I mean is - It's just not exciting at all, in my opinion. And not just because I'm used to being there and now I'm at home watching... When you go to a show, you're there for the music, sure. But what really makes it a great experience is being immersed in the environment and taking a second to just stop and look around. The people. The happiness. The excitement. The unity. All of it. Everything contributes to the experience. Watching it at home is not at all the same. The camera is on the producer/artist 75% of them (which is understandable, that's what we're there to see), but at a show you're not up there just staring at them. You can see them and what they're doing but you have everything else around you and your sole focus is not on them letterboxed into a two foot area around them. And some of it does depend on that particular artist's stage presence; I know great producers who just don't hype me up and excite me when on stage. That just not it, though. Not only do I find it boring but almost awkward in a way. For some reason, the crowd never seems to be very excited when looking out from this side of the show, either.

It's always such a buzz to see people singing along at shows. I can't wait to share the rest of the music with the fans. I promise it won't be long now.""

7844,[TOMT] Hopefully a recent song. Some info inside,"There was a song in the Spotify \#Freshfriday playlist before it was updated on 6/26. Cant remember the song but i have some info that maybe one of you can help.

The vocals were a European(think Swedish or around there) and it was a guy talking about other girlfriends he had and how his first girlfriend was getting jealous.

I know thats not very descriptive but its all i really remember other than it being very good. 

Or if you have the playlist from before 6/26 downloaded, if you link it, ill look through it.

A little request, as the title says I'm looking for songs like the one in the title (link: https://soundcloud.com/lucianofficial/black-coast-trndsttr-lucian-remix ).

Lets think about which tracks we know so far.

2. [Never Sleep Alone](https://soundcloud.com/kaskade/kaskade-never-sleep-alone)

3. [Summer Nights](https://soundcloud.com/arkade/kaskade-the-brocks-summer-nights)

4. [Under The Stars](https://soundcloud.com/kaskade/kaskade-thomas-sagstad-vs)

5. [We Don't Stop](https://soundcloud.com/dpdragon/kaskade-id-we-wont-stop-coachella-2015-rip)

6. [Mercy (Feat Galantis)](https://soundcloud.com/dooyaevalift/kaskade-galantis-mercy-livekaskade-coachella-2015-rip)

Even if that is the whole album right there it would already be the album of the year in my books! And this is going up against ""Alesso - Forever"", which is one of my favorite albums right now.

7878,Anyone interested in a music blogger/journalist position?,"Hey everyone,
I run a promotional music network (advertising is not the point of this thread I promise) called Affinity FM. A couple months ago, I set up a website to further expand my reach to help other users discover and support good music. One goal I had for the website was to write blog posts about music that had just been uploaded (and just about electronic music news in general). I discovered that this job cannot be done without the help from other people because of the time commitment. I NEED YOUR HELP!!
So, I thought I'd ask this community if there are any of you that would like to use your journalistic talents by co-editing this blog/website with me?

PAY: Since the website doesn't drive much traffic at the moment, I can't afford to pay for your work, BUT in the future when this website does generate revenue I will be more than willing to set you up on some sort of pay roll via Paypal.

CREDIT: I will, of course, make sure to credit you. We can probably set up a page for your bio on the website if that is something you would like added.

ACCESS: The site is managed through wordpress. The site allows me to give access to certain parts of the website to other users. So in this case, I could give you direct access to the News page (so you can publish) and I think I can give you access to the analytics page (so you can oversee how the blog posts are doing)
If you want to get a feel for what the site looks like... 
http://www.musiconaffinityfm.com
I'm really interested in hearing back from you all, so if you are interested in this, please feel free to comment below OR contact me at samusicplaylist@gmail.com. From there, we can discuss more important details!
Thank you all for your time!
MODS If there is a better place to post this, please let me know (again, I am not trying to advertise my channel. I am asking for help from the electronic music community)

Someone posted his entire set though and I skimmed and nothing seems to fit what I remember.
What I DO know about the song is that it was pretty long and somber, and it was not your typical EDM bass heavy stuff. It was really melodic and beautiful. The entire crowd was pretty quiet and a lot of people were crying. It had a computerized voice in it, and it almost felt like it was from an outer space movie. Like, your ship's about to blow up or be sucked up into a black hole and your ship has a voice and it's trying to comfort you.

I do remember that there is evidence of songs that went from ""instrumental"" only to a song with lyrics such as [Pakito-Living on video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF-t9DYOGR0) which changed into [Pakito-Moving on Stereo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBhFSXRuWtw) and [The Sun Club-Fiesta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiuAUSkvkw0) which was mixed up with the underdog project to create [The Underdog Project-Summer Jam](https://www.google.nl/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=the+underdog+project+summer+jam&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=flV4VYW5O4Lo7Ab7yIFo) three years later and became more popular. A more recent example is [Tim Berg (Literally Avicii)-Bromance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyAc5RvtbPk) who rereleased the track with lyrics as [Seek Bromance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jrd25gjyDhE).

So basically...I am a recovering addict who recently went sober. Now that I'm not getting high anymore, I need to fill my time with productive activities - so I figured that I would like to start working on an album of my own. 

The problem is that I don't really know where to start. I did a bit of reading on musical theory but even this basic topic isn't really covered in too much depth on the web (especially in relation to EDM). 

If you have experience with music production, can you please point me in the right direction? Any information/links I can digest would be of great help.

7974,Not doing drugs at festivals,"My first time going to any EDM event was in 2013 at Sunset Music Festival (Tampa, Florida). I was 100% going for the music and had zero interest at the time for bringing or doing any drugs at all. I knew there was going to be plenty of it there but that really didn't faze me at the time. What I didn't realize was how much use there was actually going to be.Throughout the festival I saw more and more people fucked up and that really opened my eyes to how big drugs really are used at festivals. At the end of the day, I was standing by a group of people that were obviously fucked up on MDMA.(Now that I've been to more events, I know now that they were definitely rolling). Half way through the set, I saw one of the girls in that group have a seizure. Watching her friends have to pick her up and push her through thousands of people behind us really freaked me out in the moment. I just couldn't wrap my head around the thought of why anyone would do a drug that has the possibility of that happening to you. I don't want to sound like a downer or anything, almost every moment at the festival I was dancing my ass off and singing along to all the songs I loved! I've now attended a countless number of events and can say I've never done MDMA or any ""hard"" drug at a festival (or in real life for that matter). I can also say the experiences i've had are absolutely undesirable. There's multiple factors to why I choose not to do them, but I think what I saw at Sunset to that girl really did impact my view on MDMA and drugs overall. This passed weekend I went to Sunset again and it was my 7th multi-day festival. A majority of the people that know me and I tell them I don't do drugs at these festivals either are blown away or just don't believe me all. Every time I just smile and explain how its 100% not needed and you can still have such a good time. This passed Ultra I was dancing along side with a mutual friend at the megastructure. Once we left to go to a different stage, he asked me if I was rolling or not and I said no, I don't take drugs. He was completely blown away (keep in mind, he was pretty high off MDMA at the time lol) and just wouldn't stop bring up how crazy it was that I wasn't on drugs. This passed weekend the same mutual friend and I went to sunset together with some friends and he told me he decided not to do any drugs at all this festival. Once the festival ended, he came up to me, hugged me, and said thank you so much. He said because of what I said to him at Ultra, this was his first time not doing any substance at a festival. He kept going on about how much fun he had and just the greatest vibes he received!Festival and EDM are a HUGE part in my life, so it really was a touching feeling hearing someone tell me I effected there festival experience in such a positive way.

just recently started getting into EDM and I can't get enough but I keep listening to the same popular stuff so I thought I'd get some help.

What I've listened to and liked : 

- Kaskade 

- Above and Beyond (loved these guys)

- Madeon

- Hardwell 

- A couple of Steve Aoki songs

- Armin Van Buuren

- Nicky Romero (Like Aoki, kind of hit and miss for me)

- Porter Robinson.

- Dillon Francis.

- Avicii if he wasn't so overplayed, I kind of want to kill myself everytime I hear most of his songs, I tend to always like them the first couple listens though.

- Alesso

- Bassnectar

Well this is what comes to mind for now.

I've also got a weird question if that's okay :

- Can you guys guess by who some song is just by ear ? Except for Madeon and Van Buuren for some reason I just can't.

&gt; Is HARD Summer a rave or music festival?

&gt; **It's an electronic music festival.**

&gt; How did the term ‚Äúrave‚Äù get such a comeback? Every time I think of a ‚Äúrave‚Äù, it's a party at some abandoned warehouse back in the 1990s.

&gt; **Totally, that's what I always say. To me a rave is an illegal party with a bunch of kids. These festivals cost upwards of 10 million dollars to produce. I've never been to a 10 million dollar rave. For me a rave costs something like 10 grand to make. That's my definition of it but everyone else has their own take. I just feel like the word has a bad stigma to it and we're doing large scale events. In my opinion, that's not really what a rave is. But that's just my opinion and whatever people want to say, they can say it.**

Currently the list of what I listen to is pretty small but I would like to expand it based on some artists that I have liked.


skrillex (was a good intro to the genre but not huge into his stuff anymore),
ephixa,
Rusko,
some bassnectar,
some deadmau5,
The Rob Dougan matrix theme (love how epic it is)

Any and all suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thanks guys.

8070,[Discussion] What's up with big room?,"I started listening to EDM about a year ago and I instantly loved tracks like Animals, Wizard, Tremor and other big room anthems.

 A friend of mine just discovered big room so I naturally tried sending him stuff similar to what he liked. I felt so strange listening to all these songs... and I had a major throwback. Throughout this year my music taste moved towards more melodic side of the EDM - my favorite genre is Progressive House and favorite artists would be StadiumX, Tom Swoon, Paris Blohm, Steerner, Deniz Koyu, Syn Cole, Michael Brun, Axwell /\ Ingrosso, DubVision, Vicetone, Sick Individuals and similar. I didn't start hating big room - I still like hearing it every once and a while. But then I also noticed that tracks like that aren't even getting released as often nowadays.

8089,Specific type of Progressive House (examples),"I have a certain taste in EDM songs, any song that matches this profile:

- progressive house

- 'softer' melody (not harsh electro sounds)

- euphoric, dreamy feeling, caused by:

1. a soft/often sad first verse

2. ambient/echo-y sounding/dramatic build-up (shitty description, I know - it's the part where it sounds like 
the song's emotions are ""breaking down and can't take it anymore"", or alternatively ""breaking down into tears of joy because so happy"")

3. happy sounding melodic drop

- to me these songs are the best of both worlds, fusing the crisp sound of progressive house with the emotional buildup of trance (without the rather blurry sounds or throbbing-ness I get from trance)

8109,What to bring/expect to experience at EDC NY?,"Hi everyone! I'm going to my first EDC NY festival this year with my friend. I've been to over 50 concerts before, but never a multi day festival. I'm making this thread to ask what I should bring, and what I should expect to experience while there.
People have suggested camelbaks as something to bring, should I bring in phone chargers or other things, etc.?
What's the festival like? Are the rides fun/worth it?
How over crowded does it get? What's security like?
Does the stage sounds cross over and drown out other stages?
...and any other things you guys would like to share. Thanks!


P.S....please don't say things along the lines of ""it's not like las vegas"" or ""nothing compared to vegas"" or things like that...I'm well aware that the Vegas one is bigger and the flagship EDC but i'm only 20 and in school and in New England and don't have enough money to go to Las Vegas....",EDM,1429810573,Jesseroberto1894,13,1,True,2015-04-23

8140,"How I met Madeon, and played before him","Hey guys ! My name is Olivier, I'm 21, I come from Belgium and I would like to share that awesome story with you.

I'm a huge fan of Madeon since his popculture mashup, and I started making electronic music after I discovered him basically.
Few days ago, a friend of mine sent a message saying that one of his friend who is organizing the madeon concert in Brussels is looking for an opening act. He told me he was looking for an electro house dj or something, so I wasn't the right person for it at all ( I make my music, and play it live, it's a mix between loads of genre ), but I couldn't resist to try

Without a big hope, I sent my music. After two long weeks I checked my mails, and I was announced as the opening act for Madeon adventure live in Brussels.
No need to say I was the most excited person on earth at that moment. I had one week to do a live set and I worked sooooo hard for it ! ( and smoked a lot of weed to relax ahah )

The big day was here ! I prepared my macbook, launchpad, maschine and stuff carefully. My manager and good friend ( Max ) took his car and drove me to the venue ( which is absolutely awesome, in the center of Brussels with loads of beautiful gardens and vegetations). 

Reception:
""Welcome, can I help you ?"" a guy asked 
""I'm here to open for Madeon"" ( I NEVER thought I was going to say those words in my life haha, I admit I felt good to say it ) 

Me and my manager enter and we see that huuuuuuuge setup that Madeon has for his live, with visuals, mapping everywhere, huge structures from his adventure live, crazy lights. And Madeon is right there, doing his soundcheck and everything, i was like a child. He started singing "" Home"" and playing soft chords with his 88 key piano, the atmosphere was awesome

The woman that was organizing everything for the artists showed me the backstage,my personal room and madeon's one. There is also a room for all the Madeon technician crew ( They are six or seven, and have a whole bus to carry the stage everywhere around the world for his live performance ). I take a beer and eat a little bit and then I see Madeon coming from the hallway. I didn't know what to do, I was about to hide myself, too much pressure ! 

Finally I said to him "" Hey salut Hugo ! "". 
I knew his name, and we both talk french 
Madeon : "" Hey ! You're the opening act right ?..."" he struggle a little bit to remember the name "" R.O, that's it !"" with a big smile on his face. 
I discovered after that Madeon himself was choosing the opening act, I felt so honored and happy ! He told me "" I checked your music, it's really great !"". I can't describe how proud and happy I was

After that, me and my manager went in the gardens next to the venue to do some photo shoots and stuff and we had lunch in the concert's restaurant. After that, it was 19:30 and I was playing at 8pm. Pressure was on ! 

I go on stage and do my thing. The crowd was clearly waiting for Madeon, and that's an absolutely normal reaction so I did my very best to offer a cool performance before the genius go on stage.
After the last tune, the crowd made a long and big applause and I was happy :)

I took my stuff, went in the backstage and saw Madeon again, he had some time free before doing his show so we had a cigarette together with his friend/cameraman and we talked about his tour in America which starts in some days, and various other things.

9:30 pm, it was time for Madeon to go on stage ! I won't spoil you how good it was,but this guy is really from another world. Everything was insane, visuals and live performance, he's soooo inspiring. Words would be pointless here, go see him live you won't regret !

After his show, we went back in the smoking room on the backstage and talked a bit more, about production, ableton, guitar rig and all that stuff. It's hard to stay normal in those situations, because he had such an influence in my music, but I didn't want to look like a fan boy at the same time ahah.

30 minutes later it was time to go for him, he had a show the night before in Paris and he needed sleep. I understood and said goodbye. He told me "" We do the same thing next time ! "", and left. I had stars in my eyes

The reason i'm writing this is because I decided to focus on music now, I stopped school last year to be able to produce more and do my live shows around the world. And that's the kind of event that gives me hope for the future. 

So, thank you Hugo for being such an inspiring artist and person.
4 years ago, I was only discovering ableton and now I have the opportunity to play before Pretty Lights, Opiuo, Big Gigantic, and  Madeon. Believe in your dreams guys, they come true !

There will be a video of this because my manager and my girlfriend took their camera and filmed everything, I'll share it with you when it's done :) :) If you got any questions, i'll be happy to answer !

8169,Cincinnati: Best Way Stay Up To Date With EDM Scene?,"Cinci's EDM scene has been growing over the past few years, but what is the best way to know where to find the best DJs and parties? I was looking at Mynt's website today and was amazed at how many awesome DJs are playing there over the next few months (Arty, Borgeous, Tommy Trash, Moguai, Pierce Fulton and others). I have been going to shows in Cinci for years, but I feel like I am always finding out about them at the last minute unless they are at Bogart's. 

I've looked around a bit, but have not been able to find a good resource that shows upcoming events for clubs, venues and parties. Cincinnati definitely has a ton of EDM fans- I've seen packed venues at Flosstradamus, Flux Pavillion, Kaskade and tons of people at ID fest a couple of summers ago. But at the same time, I have gone to shows for artists that headline in Vegas with very few people in the crowd. And I'm not that surprised because I had only heard about the show via word of mouth from one of the openers.

If there is not a better site, would anyone be interested in starting a new sub where we can post upcoming events, showcase local talent and organize parties? If we can get more people to shows, we will be able to get more artists to come through and bigger shows. ",EDM,1427903716,mrethridge,1,2,True,2015-04-01

I am a small-known producer under the name dubau5 and claim that I can make an unholy remix of Summer by Calvin Harris, if not better than Diplo's horrible bane of music put upon Calvin's creation.  I agree that Calvin is mainstream and is not ""that spectacular"", but its like he made a medium rare grilled porkchop and some diplo guy needed to go so bad that he released his chorro on the porkshop. Disgusting comparison, but thats how I feel.

I claim that I will stream myself working on this remix starting from scratch to the end in one 2-hour video, upload to youtube, and will be much more creatively done than Diplo's work, no doubts, no exceptions. I will do this, if you upvote and comment on this post. Once Im convinced by a lot of upvoters and commentors, I WILL stream and make this remix for the humble public of EDM to be impacted by a beautious remake of Calvin's track. I promise that i will be unholy.

Vote with me and I will make sure I save EDM by contributing a work of art and eliminating this disgrace to EDM culture. Not only will I produce success and prove wrong of a seemingly famous artist, but will do so in a timely fashion. :)

I'll start with some mainstream, but vital basics. Now your turn, go!

Sure, many people are not fans of his music (and the stuff like it), but there's no arguing that many tracks of this era were exceptionally successful. And I really do hate to use Skrillex as an example (because of the wide love/hate spectrum of music lovers regarding him out there) but I just remember his remix of Promises being massive at that time and that song just takes me back. It's a hallmark of that period, for sure. I love all music; Especially electronic. From the underground all the way to the mainstream radio 'crap' that so many lovers of 'authentic' electronic music lovers dislike. And even though my music library is growing by the hour, it just doesn't feel the same, for some reason. Perhaps it's because I only  discovered electronic music just before the mainstream breakthrough (Angry Goose, Rusko, etc. around 2010). I guess I'm digressing...

You all probably get this question a lot, but where should I start? I don't want to spend a couple hundred bucks on big programs like Ableton or Cubase, but I don't want something that's shit. I just want some bare minimum software that can really help me develop before I invest lots into making music.

All I can say is:
-I don't want to get any hardware, such as keyboards, MIDI, or any other big walls of knobs that you'd see in a studio.  I'm short on money.

-I don't want to spend a couple hundred dollars. I just want to see if I like it and if I should move forward.

-something simple that I can log into and within a few weeks id have a fairly ok idea of how to actually use the software.

* Is having ghost producers commonplace in EDM nowadays? If so, how do you tell who has them outside of the obvious ones like Tiesto who is on tour constantly but always pumps out new music?

* If it is commonplace, how do you, as an EDM fan, get past it? I recently heard the term ""Ghost producer"" months ago and it just blew my mind to hear the notion that a lot of EDM groups simply do not produce their own music... especially when a lot of them don't even have vocals, so EVERYTHING of theirs is done by someone else.

I understand that this is really prevalent in pop music, but atleast in pop music a lot of times they credit other people for their writing... some pop stars even come out and admit they just record and perform, no writing at all.

I get it that this may seem silly to get upset over, but it really does upset me that this is even a thing. I REALLY hope it is not commonplace. Thanks for your time.",EDM,1423189138,SativaSammy,12,0,True,2015-02-05

The easiest way to participate would be to complete my online survey, which is completely anonymous and will take just a few minutes. The link is [here](https://oxy.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_9EJHR1Uwm4Qou9v).

I am also conducting interviews via e-mail, or in person if you're in the LA area.

I'll send you some questions and you can type your replies to whichever questions you like, and omit whatever questions you don't want to answer.

I've been going to shows and raves since I started college and they've been a super fun and awesome part of my life, and I'm really interested in critically analyzing how they've changed over time and what the scene(s) look like now. I'm specifically looking at which factions of the scene constitute a subculture as it did in the 90's and which have become mainstream or commercialized. (more info in my consent forms).

Here are the baseline prices: http://www.tomorrowland.com/en/ticket-prices). 

We will select the top 2 offers (a backup incase the first offer flops), and contact them via email by the 24th of January. We will set up to meet at a public place within the GTA (Mississauga, Toronto, Oakville etc) to do the exchange and purchase. This MUST be done between the 26th and 30th of January, 5pm EST. All orders have to be paid before the deadline. We will buy the tickets and exchange payment (on the spot e-transfer preferred), so you can personalize them using your information. This way, everyone will feel comfortable about what is happening.

Again, this abides by Tomorrowland Rules completely. We are not reselling tickets, we are simply selling the opportunity to purchase guaranteed tickets to this amazing event!

Thanks for your attention, and good luck to everyone interested ‚ò∫",EDM,1421282983,[deleted],0,1,True,2015-01-14

Basically, it's a chord that plays in between each beat.

During 2015 I'll be holding various producer challenges that aim to get producers out of their comfort zone, and make them produce something they might not otherwise.

Since challenges without rewards aren't that fun, I'll also be judging the entries and the best one will receive a prize. Prizes can range from a cash prize to vouchers from online music stores and studio equipment.
More info about all of this AND the first challenge can be found at http://qdrmusic.com/challenges
(sorry for the personal site mention, no other way possible)

The challenges will of course be free to enter and open to everyone. Whether you're a beginner or a veteran

I have done challenges in the past but this you're I'll be holding them regularly to keep producers motivated.
Last year I did and '80's vibe' challenge which was well received. The winner of that one can be heard here.

But wow! I went to see MEGA last night, and the whole night was awesome as was expected. When Yellow Claw was performing, a voice came over the speakers and the lights came on telling everyone to evacuate the building, that there had been an incident. 

Literally no one moves, everyone thinks that it's Flux's cool way of coming on stage; but then the voice comes back. ""This is not a drill."" Me and my friend who I came with started walking to the back of the venue, and the entire crowd just starts screaming ""WE WANT FLUX"". When we reach the back, there's an area closed off by the yellow tape and a few cops telling people, ""someone fell, keep moving"". Turns out this guy was bumped so hard he lost his balance and fell over the railing. Everyone was PISSED but they didn't know how serious it was.

Sorry for the wall of text, I'm still kind of in denial! Here's an article and a video I took of people in disbelief and refusing to leave.

edit: so this got a little more attention than i was expecting. unfortunately after spending some time in critical condition, the man who is now identified as ""Cody"" died. it's a really awful thing to have happened at such a positive event, and there are a lot of opinions being thrown around but the bottom line is that someone died and that's never justifiable; it seems to me that this death was faultless. next time i rave, i'll definitely dedicate it to this poor guy.

8588,EDM prediction for 2015,"Well its been another year of EDM festivals, concerts, and what not. Of course, music changes and I think EDM is moving in another direction. 

Around  2009, Electronic Dance Music rose from the underground, where house and techno were mostly prevalent i think, and has steadily rose. With the help of Electro House, it has become kind of mainstream.

Looking back, I remember hearing a lot more Electro type house on the radio during 2010. Around 2012 it was pretty common. This is my chronology for EDM trends since.

* 2009-? **American Dupstep** like Skrillex came around this time. I remember kids in my high school liked the sound. I'm not sure if American Dubstep fell off or not honestly. Imo, it sucks compared to UK dub.

* 2009-2010 **Moombahton** came on. I didn't follow EDM closely until 2012, but from what I know, Moombahton wasn't crazily popular and was/is still kind of underground.

* 2010-Present **Electro House** seems pretty mainstream and a good way of getting the masses to appreciate the scene. I don't think this is gonna die down in 2015, its pretty likeable and danceable.

* 2011-Present **The future bass/beats** scene started to gain traction sometime this year. By this I mean stuff coming from labels like soulection and HW&amp;W. Pretty chill stuff, danceable too. I don't think its slowing down anytime soon since these guys are creating new sounds and doing new things.

* 2012-Present **Trap** started around 2012. This is when I really started paying attention. I like hip-hop, Trap rap was really popular, and EDM Trap was the best of both with DJ Snake's New Slaves Remix, RL Grime's Love Sosa, etc. Although some producers have put out some EPs, I think Trap has run it's course, just like Trap Rap has. Since its relatively new, it'll prob go behind the front scenes and have a nice stable audience.

* 2013-Present **Future House** Is this even its own sub category? It sounds a lot like Deep House to me. Either way its nice. I think it'll have the same success that Moombahton had though, and finish with a nice following.

* 1980- Present- **Jersey Club** Finally, Jersey has gained some attention! I think 2015 will be its year since Lido/Trippy Turtle has been producing nice remixes and songs. Growing up in MD, I loved Baltimore club and Jersey is pretty similar. Jersey will probably have a nice year or two before it goes back underground.

So for 2015, I see Electro House remaining popular, Trap will slow down even more unless some bangers come out, and Jeresey will keep coming up as long as Trippy, Sliink, and other keep putting out stuff(Mostly Trippy and some new producer might pop up). I think ""Futurue"" House might get a little traction, but it seems like a stretch. 

To be honest, as much as i love Trap, I'm getting tired of it. Maybe cause I listen to so much hip-hop and listened to trap all through high school. 

Also, Diplo will still be king. That is all.

Anyways, comment, and tel me what you think. Sorry If I missed any important trends...these are just what I see. Please, nothing negative, these are just what i think,",EDM,1418806786,brandoldkid,20,7,True,2014-12-17

I am now 18, and I feel as if EDM has its own high when I listen to it. I don't need drugs to enjoy the music. It gives me the goosebumps when I hear the buildup and the drop. Recently I started to hang out with a new group of friends who all enjoy and breathe EDM just like me. We go all out at festivals and any rave that is going on. We live for it and live till the next one. At festivals I feel that everyone is united and we all have fun while we enjoy the music. It is very different at a rap concert, I feel like everyone wants to fight each other and everyone is aggressive. I love life more with EDM in it, PLUR people. I think more positive of things, and when im down because of something, ill throw on some progressive and just get a instant mood lift. It is amazing what music can do, not just one person but many people. Just wanted to share that with you guys. ",EDM,1418838543,fratstar315,85,138,True,2014-12-17

I heard the song at a Detroit Red Wings game. Unbeknownst to me at the time, the teams were about to make their final on ice entrance before the faceoff. The arena was filled with idle fan chatter and out of nowhere a single note sounding like a low steam whistle begins playing at a steady beat of around 60 BPM,  and accelerates tempo gradually up to like 130 BPM while the pitch gradually bends higher. 

Just as it get's to the point where everyone in the building is like ""what fuck is that?"" the beat drops just as the goalies break from between the boards and fly on to the ice like giant bird like monstrosities and the rest of the team floods onto the rink behind them. It was incredible, and I need to hear that song again. I don't remember the song content after the intro but I wanna say it was house.

Absolutely fucking epic, Most people were probably expecting some sort of Liquid Dubstep supersaw clusterfuck, which would have been awesome, but they completely subvert people's expectations by doing a Progressive Trance influenced Big-Room Electro-House track, which they have been known to do before (e.g. The Truth from Seven Lions and Choose Me I from Xilent)..

There isn't a single Half-Time moment, instead it has got some sick occasional breakbeats and chord progression/mode changes to really change the energy.

You can tell they listened to a lot of old school trance, probably a lot of PvD, BT, Sasha and Digweed kinda shit. Epic track :)",EDM,1417662992,[deleted],1,3,True,2014-12-03

Short story: Im listening metal basicly all my life. I was always into heavy stuff, also a guitar player for 10+ years. I never really digged most of the EDM stuff tbh, until friend popped some really heavy, cool tunes for me. I then realized i actually love some of it, precisly- *heavy, deep, low face melting bass!* As I am really lost in all these EDM sub-genres I decided i will post some of my favourite songs and hopefully you will help me find some similar artist/songs. I dont think what I like is dubstep, as most of the popular dubstep soungs are kinda too much of everything for me. So here are some examples:

Zeds Dead - Rude Boy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdXDT-5jci0

Blue Foundation - Eyes On Fire (Zeds Dead Remix) 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUGzY-ihqWc
2:26 drop is so damn good for me I lose it everytime i hear it

Some ""old"" Skrillex. Fucking Die1

Naked Fish-Displaced. (dear God, the drop..)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xk7jZmQgrQ

8664,My favorite tracks from 2014. What are yours?,"So I did this last year, it was a lot of fun and I found out about a lot of great songs, so I thought we should do it again. My top 5 tracks from this year:  
  
*[ODESZA - Say MY Name](https://soundcloud.com/odesza/say_my_name) Really their whole album is amazing!  
*[Dillon Francis - Not Butter](https://soundcloud.com/dillonfrancis/dillon-francis-not-butter) Again, his entire album gets me jumping.  
*[Jack √ú - Take √ú There](https://soundcloud.com/diplo/jack-u-take-u-there-feat-kiesza) First single from Diplo/Skrillex project!  
*[Porter Robinson - Divinity](https://soundcloud.com/porter-robinson/divinity-feat-amy-millan) Again, his entire album is breathtaking.  
*[Kygo - Firestone](https://soundcloud.com/kygo/firestone-ft-conrad) Released this week and IT'S SO GOOD.   
  
Tried to be diverse. I found it extremely difficult to narrow it down to only 5 songs, since there were so many great debut albums (Knife Party, Zhu, Steve Aoki, Afrojack, Odesza, Dillon Francis, Elliphant, etc) or simply just new albums (Porter Robinson, Bassnectar, Deadmau5, Tiesto, David Guetta, Skrillex). 2014 was the year of the EDM Death Machine :P

* Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike - Yemaya

* Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike vs Deniz Koyu - Roads

* Fedde Le Grand vs Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike - ID

8707,Just curious...,"Please don't take this the wrong way, I'm just curious about other peoples music.

Personally I'm not a fan of EDM. I think alot of the big mainstream artists just kinda lost it when they became famous. Meaning they lost the style they maintained for so many years. I listen to alot of underground dubstep, techno and music that has yet to be given a name. I feel those artist have their own distinct sounds and I don't really hear it in EDM. 

*What are the EDM artists that have their own style?*

I go to quite some techno parties, the underground, dark styles. I've been to parties with 3000 people and parties with 250 people. When you go to smaller venues the crowd gets more ""pure"", really there for the music. I also don't really see that in EDM, since i've never really heard of really smaller edm parties.

8710,"Thinking of starting an electronic music club(extracurricular) at my school, thoughts? (x-post from /r/electronicmusic)","So I just got this idea a few days ago. It's definitely still in planning. I was thinking it would be a great way to sorta connect the electronic listeners on campus I guess. It would be sort of a wide sweeping club, with events/activities tailored to listeners, producers, dj's, promoters, basically everything.  My (very rough) plan would be


**Every 2 weeks**: 

* General Body Meeting, where we touch base with all members, talk about latest releases, break out artists, maybe the producers could share their finished tracks. We'd talk about the upcoming events from the surrounding area, perhaps coordinate some carpooling or something.  Some of the promoters here give discounts to shows if you buy tickets in large numbers, so I think that this would be a good way to sorta throw a bone to the local scene as well as allowing the club to bond a bit more

**Once a month**: 

* Production specific meeting: maybe sharing of WIPs, feedback, we could talk about specific production techniques perhaps, maybe work with some VST synths. Collabs.

* DJ specific meeting. I'm not a DJ so some advice would be helpful, but I was thinking feedback on mixes, mixing strategy, networking advice, people could bring in their setups for a demonstration/explanation

**Once a year**: 

* ~~Maybe like a drug safety meeting before festival season, pass out testing kits, demonstrate how to use them, and other rave safe type stuff. I'm not sure if the school would allow this part but it seems important to me.~~ 

* Perhaps we could maybe even throw a show later on in the club's life if it gathers enough support, hopefully featuring the club's DJ's/Producers.  


So yea that's my plan. Nothing is set in stone yet, and I'm sure that if it became an actual club that this would change to match the needs of the members. What are your thoughts?  Is this something that you would like to be a part of it it was at your school? Is there something you don't like, or something you would like that isn't mentioned? If your school has/had a club like this, how did it turn out? This would be at University of Florida in case you were wondering

8723,"Does the Trance market now have a ""copy-paste"" production culture?","**First off, I'd like to clarify that this post is not to criticize or defame the quality of certain productions. I'd just like to get some other opinions on this.**

I've loved EDM since I was a kid but didn't get into it until I was 16-17. I started listening to ASOT podcasts in 2008 and 2009 and got into trance pretty quick. However, browsing YouTube and looking up related videos, I really began to appreciate the 1990's-2003 productions and it currently fills up a majority of my library. Not much into the newer stuff.

I wanted to run this by /r/EDM to see if I'm not alone in my observation. Since 2004, a lot of Trance music has been using a harder bass standard and almost the exact same ""clap"" effect with virtually identical BPM. A lot of things you hear on ASOT have attempted (and failed) anthem melodies with the same effects and exact same mastering. 15 years ago, the bass was a distinctly softer and varied sound with completely different claps and synthesizer effects that were very individual.

It's possible this may be exclusive to Armada Music, but I'd like to get some more educated opinions on it. Everything I hear out of Armada seems to sound the same with little to no variation or creativity. It's a shame because many artists I appreciate from the 2000-era have signed on and I feel the quality focus has gone in an uninteresting direction. 

My lack of experience with other companies like Ajunabeats makes me unable to claim that Trance as a genre follows a ""copy-paste"" production culture of base song construction.

The amount of songs being presented by people who aren't big named artists seems to have decreased a lot. I enjoyed see/listening to the big name artists' songs, but I also liked finding songs that weren't by incredibly famous artists. I was wondering if this has to do with soundcloud monetizing everything, but if anyone can answer that would be great.

8774,"Written story inspired by Porter Robinson's 'Worlds' album. Prologue + Chapter One. (First post on Reddit, may contain errors, many apologies in advance!)","Hello all! This is my first post on Reddit, and I've gone through every possible avenue to ensure that this post doesn't break any rules on this particular Sub. 

In short, 'Worlds' was a very inspirational album for me, and it showed me that taking risks can sometimes yield the best results versus taking the safe route every time. 

A little about me, I write for a music based website, ConnecticutEDM.com and am very involved in the EDM community. I first found my love of EDM in a beautiful roller rink back in the day, and a couple of the first songs I'd heard were 'One More Time' by Daft Punk and (no, I'm really serious about this one) Sandstorm by Darude. I went through many phases during adolescence, picking up and dropping many types of music along the way, and back in 2010 I was reintroduced to EDM and have since made it a huge part of my life. I saw the end of Turntable.FM and watched many artists rise from unknowns to become festival headliners.

Writing has always been a huge passion, and I've run the gauntlet in terms of things I've written, but I've never written something inspired by music, or what I perceived was the story behind an album or something along those lines. 
I considered writing an album by album short story series based on the discography of one Buckethead, but his continually expanding library makes me shudder at the thought of how little of a life I would have if I tried to keep up with the man with the bucket on his head.  

I invite you all to read and enjoy and PLEASE critique my venture into the unknown. It's a big thing for me to share this with those who love EDM like I do, and I hope the reception is well met. 

P.s I hope I did this right. Don't expect miracles from a complete newby =P

Quote from article: 

""Consider the fact that it takes roughly one million spins on Pandora for a songwriter to earn just $90. Avicii‚Äôs release ‚ÄúWake Me Up!‚Äù that I co-wrote and sing, for example, was the most streamed song in Spotify history and the 13th most played song on Pandora since its release in 2013, with more than 168 million streams in the US. And yet, that yielded only $12,359 in Pandora domestic royalties‚Äî which were then split among three songwriters and our publishers. In return for co-writing a major hit song, I‚Äôve earned less than $4,000 domestically from the largest digital music service."" - Aloe Blacc

The video starts with her in an office building as a secretary or something. Her hair is up and she has glasses on. At some point in the video she ditches work and ends up on the beach or outside. She takes her hair down and has sunglasses on. If I remember right, the song is fairly upbeat and poppy sounding.  I believe the vocalist isn't actually part of the main group and was just featured on the song.

8804,"First we had the dubstep surge, then trap saw a major popularity increase. What's next?",I was going to call it a fad but it really isn't. These were the two most recent genres that went from niche to mainstream edm to being used in top 40 songs relatively shortly.

8806,[AskEDM] Why do so many EDM tracks start at 30 seconds?,"So today I was using an iTunes' feature that allows you to change the starting time of your songs. I wanted to make manual ""Radio Edits"" of songs I have in my library, and I noticed a sort of strange rule: each song either starts right away at time 00:00, or they have a build-up pre-intro that is exactly 29-31 seconds long before their actual intro. That's very strange, because it doesn't seem to be only a label or an artist signature, it's almost a rule among my EDM tracks. 

Here are a few examples that start at the 30 seconds mark:

* https://soundcloud.com/dillonfrancis/dillon-francis-martin-garrix-set-me-free
* https://soundcloud.com/spinninrecords/danny-howard-futuristic-polar-bears-romani-original-mix-1
* https://soundcloud.com/dillonfrancis/dillon-francis-whats-that-spell-feat-tjr

For the following songs, the soundcloud version doesn't have the 30 secs pre-intro, but the ""original mix"" does:

* Freaks have more fun - Dada life [So much dada]
* Made for this - Sick Individuals [Revealed]
* Wait for you - Dannic &amp; Shermanology [Revealed]

These are just a few example so you can see it in action, but I found many more! 

I guess these are intended to be used by DJs in mix, but even so, why is it always 30 seconds. Is this a kind of known rule?",EDM,1415301828,Allezxandre,8,1,True,2014-11-06

* The opening sequence kinda sounds like La Roux's ""Bulletproof"".

The sample before the drop is something like, ""Now raise 'em up and get down!"" Song sounded like it could have been a NERVO original, it had the characteristic bouncy bass and catchy/repetitive melody that you hear in a lot of their tracks. Glitchy build, dirty sounding bass...

8855,"I am discouraged by the futile and absurd genre-whoring sometimes found in the EDM community. I don't know what ""Glitch Jungle Skaboopity Boop"" means. Can you just listen to this song and tell me how to find more like it?","I've literally never found a reliable term for the sort of EDM I enjoy. I've been told to look into a variety of things. No matter what though, every Glitch Hop Skaboopity Bop Jumbo Jungle Grind song I try seems to have a 50/50 shot of having what I've come to refer to as a ""diarrhea drop"".

A diarrhea drop is when, halfway through a song, a 'drop' will come around, turning what seemed like good music at first, into degenerate, knuckle-dragging, WUMP WOMP FUMP PBTHTHLTHLT dubs mcnubs nonsense.

Here are some things I've come to associate with this phenomenon, and act as tip-offs that one of these diarrhea drops is coming in a song. **Keep in mind that this is partially tongue-in-cheek, I'm obviously using hyperbole, and I'm oversimplifying/generalizing for the sake of brevity**:

* A (European) DJ saying ""are you ready to turn it up?"" or some other 'pump it up' phrase
* Crowd sounds
* Snare drum that increases in metered increments for more than a few seconds
* Total absence of bass or low tones
* Anyone saying anything about bass, subs, or volume
* Overusing sirens

So, let me try to give you an example (d.drop: 1:15).

[Felix Cartal - Tonight feat. Maia Ivarsson (Autoerotique Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGUp7ysfHLs)

I really enjoyed the beginning of this song. I definitely have a weakness for some of the ""poppy"" conventions that EDM vets frown upon (eg. Ellie Goulding's voice). Anyway, I heard it in a big stupid 60 minute Youtube mix, and stopped what I was doing to check what song it was. I checked it out, turned it up, and was really smiling until exactly 1:15 into the song. 

The diarrhea drop. 

The vocals vanish and are replaced by pips and squeaks and beeps. At first, I think I'm shitting my pants, but I quickly come to recognize it as yet another EDM song that commits suicide halfway through. Suddenly, I'm transported back to being in class and frowning at the 2 or 3 different 18 year olds blasting tinny Skrillex and Deadmau5 out the Beats By Dre headphones (which are paid for by financial aid) they wore around their necks.

Another example (d. drop: 2:35).

[Felix Cartal - Tonight feat. Maia Ivarsson (Botnek Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_symyTYtck) 

Sounds like I'm having a stroke while talking to a Rastafarian dude. Song is instantly terrible.

I fucking hate the diarrhea drop. Every new song I find is tinged by dread and fear that each new build-up will be resolved by letting a cat walk across the keyboard in Fruity Loops 2007 Edition. 

So, my question here is simple: **how do I avoid songs that do this?** Is it a genre or trend with a name I can stay away from? If it's too ambiguous, can you give me some ideas for things to search for that will at least have more of the things I like (such as the beginning of that song)?

I'd appreciate any advice, perspective, or info you'd be willing to provide on this topic. Thanks for reading.

**Here's an edit for all the delicate southern belles who are having trouble focusing on the issue as opposed to my sense of humor:**

**1. Suck my huge, pendulous nuts.**

&gt; **""Keep in mind that this is partially tongue-in-cheek, I'm obviously using hyperbole, and I'm oversimplifying/generalizing for the sake of brevity[...]"".**

**2. Expressing a negative opinion of something isn't innately wrong. It is okay to say ""I don't like Taco Bell."", and it's also okay to say ""I think Taco Bell tastes bad."" Discussion forums are not here exclusively so you can high five other people who have the same opinions as you.**

**3. I also went back and bolded the important parts, and this entire edit, because apparently this is a thing we have to do now to cater to the cretins who talk about things they don't even read.**",EDM,1414085303,wooberries,55,19,True,2014-10-23

8894,Thoughts on Denial EP by Detective Orange?,"[Link to the EP.](http://bandcamp.sectionz.com/album/denial)

So Detective Orange has followed up his album Apples And Oranges with an EP called Denial. It just came out 3 days ago, and having listened to it, I have prepared a little review of it. For those who have listened to it, what do you think of it?

My review:

Denial- Nice little intro to the album, refreshingly different as a piano ballad, and with interesting chords. I admire Detective Orange for having the self-restraint to make an intro like this.

OMG I Can't Even- I like the hook, but the title and drop sample remind me a little too much of #SELFIE. Not enough to prevent me from enjoying the song, but still a tad annoying. The drop is interesting, with metallic bass sounds and an interesting energy to it. Not the best I've heard, but not terrible.

Something Dirty- Again, good hook and buildup, but average drop. It sounds a lot like the previous track on the drop, but unlike OMG I Can't Even, it feels more chillstep-ish, as it doesn't sound very energetic and has an interesting 3/4 rhythm to it. Not anything special, but still a fun little dubstep track if you're in the mood for it.

Won't Be Long- I swear, this, Something Dirty and OMG I Can't Even use the exact same metallic bass synth on the drop. Again, this song carries the same theme and atmosphere as the previous songs- fun, light melody, blazing guitar riff, chopped vocals and dark, chill drop. Not a bad track, despite its similarities to the previous songs. 

Muddle In Filth- On the whole, this track is quite unremarkable- it uses that same metallic bass that is in every previous track on this album, has a non-noteworthy hook, and lacks the energy of some of his other tracks. And yet, I can't be too hard on it- that's the funny thing about Detective Orange- no matter how unremarkable his production may be, I still have liked everything I've heard from him. Plus, the harpsichord, violin and horns were a nice touch.

Without You- A somewhat underwhelming track, considered how hyped it was in this EP's promotion- Q'Aila's vocals, while not terrible, are barely distinguishable from any other generic EDM vocalist, and Detective Orange's production, while noteworthy in the buildup, just goes with the same thing we heard on the rest of the EP for the drop, while adding a few lower wobbles. Again, this song lacks the energy needed to make it a good dance track, but still is fairly enjoyable if you can put yourself in the right mindset.

Overall, this EP was pretty disappointing for me- it seems like Detective Orange's strong point has always been buildups and hooks, and that is extremely evident on this EP. A lot of the time, the drops feel scattered and unfocused, as if he just didn't know what to do or how to integrate the melody well into the drop so he just randomly put together a bunch of sludgy, slow basslines. While the drops aren't *awful*, and are fairly enjoyable in their own right, I still find that this EP could have been done a lot better in the drop department. The atmosphere of the release is very dark and menacing-sounding, in stark contrast to the bright and happy electro of Apples And Oranges, and I think that's where most of the problem comes from. Apples And Oranges is fantastic because it shows that Detective Orange knew that he was best at making bright and energetic dubstep, and while I can see what he was *trying* to do with this EP, I think that this experiment should not be repeated.

And yet, I can't hate this EP. As I mentioned, Detective Orange's production somehow manages to be unique even when he is making generic-sounding dubstep, and while it's nowhere close to being as good as Apples And Oranges, this EP is still good to listen to as chillstep. Though I don't want him to continue this style, I still think that you should check it out and support one of the more gifted producers out there right now.

But what do you guys think?

I view it like this. DJs are artists of music, but not musicians. They do not make music as much as they manipulate music into a new form to produce a new product which may exceed the sum of its parts. Like adding different colours to a canvas to create a picture.
 
I compare this to ""musicians"" who are more directly involve in the base creation. You can have 100 people play the same song on a guitar and each one of them is going to give you a different impression of the song while playing the same notes.

8897,New to EDM,"Hey there late night people. I'm 26 and I was just introduced to the electronic/EDM/rave scene after my friends insisted on bringing me to Lovefest in Honolulu (where I am from). After one fantastic night of bass, lightshows, hugs, new friends, and an absolutely amazing community of people, I felt like I was finally home. I walked away a changed man. For the past year, I was in a place where my job and classes pretty much controlled my life, but I just moved to Seattle, and for the first time in a long time, I have the time to get into the thick of it.
I pretty much know 0 people in Seattle right now minus co-workers, but I'm looking to get out, listen to some great music, and share that feeling (and some lights).
So anyways, I guess I'm just looking for some advice on getting out there into the community. What kind of events should I hit up? Which ones can I hit up by myself? I'm just looking to chill with great people, not looking to hook up. And as for etiquette, what is expected of me? (What is ok for a happy 26 y/o guy to wear to try to help people smile? Kandi? Gum? Ok to bring amateur lightshows?)  I'm also new to reddit, so if I'm in the wrong section just point me the right way :) And yes, I AM a noob, that's why I'm here, and I appreciate any help! Always open to new artists too. Currently listening to Feed Me, thoughts?

Fernando was born in 1995 in San Salvador. Since he was very little he showed a keen interest in very diverse music. He has influences ranging from 70‚Äôs rock to 90‚Äôs hip-hop and reggae, from El Salvador‚Äôs native music to Chemical Brothers, Deep Dish, early Tiesto and simply good music. Faceless has shared the decks with Avicii, Dash Berlin, David Guetta, Francis Davila, Ferk and many others. 
At age 12 he was approached by a schoolmate and ex-faceless22 partner (Manuel Gutierrez) which introduced him to DJing software, a year later he managed to get his hands on production software (Ableton). He began producing electronic music in 2008 having decided that this is the life he wants for himself, the life of a DJ/Producer with a hectic tour schedule.

8923,Why is it that physical appearance (clothes/make-up/looks) is paramount to talent/skill for female DJs in the EDM industry?,"Looking at popular/top of the list DJs, I've realized that:

Male DJs tend to dress casually (T-shirts, jeans, cotton hoodies, caps, sneakers) in monochromes/dark colours; there's minimal effort shown in dressing. 

If male DJs aren‚Äôt in casualwear, they don costumes (usually just masks and headgear in addition to their casual wear). It seems that male DJs fabricate and don iconic costumes for branding (another way of taste-making?), entertainment, privacy reasons. Daft Punk (who have rarely been seen without their helmets on, unlike DJs like Deadmau5 and Nicky Romero who only wear headpieces occasionally during performances) mentioned their faces aren‚Äôt good-looking and would rather have the audience focus on their music‚Äîthis could mean physical appearance/attractiveness still matters in male DJs, though it is still secondary to the quality of music they produce?

For female DJs, there seems to be an assumption that provocativeness goes hand-in-hand with them. It's not uncommon to see female DJs dressed scantily (in lingerie, swimwear, hot pants, skin-tight dresses etc.).

Even if a female DJ dresses more conservatively, it is still evident that she puts more effort into dress/making a fashion statement than a male DJ. She wears make-up, styles her hair, accessorizes (bracelets, necklaces, sunglasses, scarves etc.) and dresses according to fashion trends/sets her own style. Note that these female DJs are usually not as popular as model DJs. Still, I feel it goes to show that dress &amp; physical appearance is more important for female DJs than for their male counterparts. She knows she has to dress well as the audience judges her more on her appearance than for her DJ skills.

* I know there will always be outliers in every trend (I am FULLY aware of the exceptions), but this is a common observation I've noticed so far.

8925,I'm at a conundrum. Could you guys help me look for music/songs/subs/genres that cater to a certain style I like?,"I thought of posting here first since I think this sub basically is the general genre umbrella I think. Anyway, it's hard to explain. I'm from a third world country and let's just say I am not cultured or properly versed enough to classify EDM music that well. 

I'm into club and house and rave music. (Not even sure if that's what they're really called) I basically like fast bpms, heavy bass thumps, and ridiculously filthy drops that are heavy too. Think Hardstyle but not too ravey davey. 

These qualities need not necessarily come all together. For instance, I've been enjoying trap music recently. I've come to like songs like RL Grime's Tell Me or Djemba Selassie's Bootleg of Core. 

For club music, I don't really know any titles that I like but do you have any tracklists I can listen to that are of the type of songs that are played when its full on ""dance/party"" mode in a club?",EDM,1412925182,_Duality_,2,1,True,2014-10-10

8964,Thinking of making a new DNB show.,"Hello there ! I want to bounce an idea off DNB listneners in this sub. I listen to alot of DNB and a bit of progressive trance. Among trance podcasts and shows, there is alot of really good ones with a guy on mic IDing tracks, giving shout outs to new talents and generaly providing context to the music that is being played on a show. For example : A State of Trance, Global DJ Broadcast and the absolute best music show ever (in terms of execution): Solaris International.

So...On DNB scene, there is NONE like this (none that i know of). I mean, sure we've got alot of podcasts and shows, but they all are basicaly just DJ sets and nothing else. The only actual DNB show that i know of is Friction's gig on BBC Radio 1 and it absolutely sucks imo. I mean, Friction plays good tunes for sure, but there is too many jingles and ads in the show...Which is iritating, alot.

tl;dr: I am actually thinking of making my own DNB show/podcast where i would play tunes, ID them and pitch interesting tracks from ""indie"" producers. Making it like 1-1,5 hours long and playing the whole spectrum of tunes (starting funky but dark, continuing neuro and finishing with liquid chillouts)

What do you guys think ? Is it something that you would listen to ? (My english sucks tho, gotta work on it for a bit before turning on a mic :D)",EDM,1411592374,Casper522,1,2,True,2014-09-24

ALSO ****I attended Life in Color last weekend (best event of my life) and dropped 200mg of MDMA, and wondering how bad it is if I take 200mg of MDMA again two weeks later.

I was not hung-over at all the next day and have yet to feel any negative side effects. 

Everywhere has been telling me to wait at least a month before dropping again, is 2 weeks enough time or am I going to fuck up my brain?

Here it is:

                  June 2012: Swedish House Mafia Announces Break up


           ‚ÄúOne good thing about music, when it hits you, you feel no pain.‚Äù
                                                  -Bob Marley

	Today is a day of remembrance. Remembrance of a certain group that mended wounded souls around the globe, brought people together, and changed the music world entirely. The Swedish House Mafia, having given us the gift of their uplifting melodies in recent years, has decided to disband. Festival stages and disc jockey booths worldwide dim their lights in respect to the three men that did more for us as a people than we could have ever asked for. 
	But how? But Why? Whatever for? We ask ourselves these questions in a time of panic. We are left broken hearted with our heads in our hands. Our heroes are leaving us. How can we go on to live without them? Well, to understand it we must remove ourselves from the moment and reflect. We must examine how far we have been lead by their creations. 

We buy our tickets.
	We stand in line.
		We want to forget.
Ticket booth thresholds like marathon finish lines.
	We‚Äôre tired of life.
		We wait to forget.
Shoulder to shoulder with strangers; our spirits rise.
	Lights lift, the very strings of our hearts
		We start to forget.
Bass booms through crowds; matching the pulse.
	Throwing pain at our feet, we dance on it.
		We forget.
There is an unspoken peace with the world and one another.
	Afflictions evaporate, we love again.
		We forgive and forget.
We emerge on the other side of night; better people.
	Freed from our demons; we are cleansed.
		We live.
	
	This music has saved so many. The Swedish House Mafia has pulled many hearts from dark places and restored their joy. This is what we, as a people, must remember. They may never rekindle the spark that set fire to such a euphoric musical boom, but we will always have our hearts. We will always have the faith they restored to look upon in times of sadness or fear.


                                    We came. We Raved. We loved.

9024,"Wolfgang Gartner: His upcoming album, opinion on dance music, and his ""sound"" (long text post)","[Link to his FB post](https://www.facebook.com/djwolfganggartner/posts/10152674180853236)

Most of the time you don't know you're writing an album until you're already a few songs into it, at least that's how it seems to work for me. I started working on this album in July of 2013, unbeknownst to myself. That summer was one of the biggest turning points in my headspace I've ever experienced, mirrored by probably one of the biggest turning points that dance music as a genre has ever seen. In the world of DJs and dance music, summer is Festival Season. It's a global thing; summer festival season is the ultimate peak of the year for most DJs, consumers, and anybody who works in the ""EDM"" (as much as I hate that acronym) industry. My tour schedule was jam-packed last summer with festivals almost every weekend, as it is every summer now. These are the events where everybody premiers their new music, all the newest most exclusive promos are played, and you really start to get a feel for the state of the music, the industry, and what's on the horizon.


It was summer festival season of 2013 when I heard what was on the musical horizon and started doing some serious pontificating about the future of dance music and what role I wanted to play in it. There were a number of songs released which defined a new era of ""EDM,"" dominated by an incredibly formulaic sound: giant kick drums, big snare buildups with a predictable catch-phrase at the end, leading into a ""drop"" with a percussive, almost metallic rave melody. Suddenly everything being played at festivals and clubs sounded exactly like this; it began to dominate the charts, and a few select songs with the right machine behind them crossed over to commercial pop radio as an almost ""novelty"" in the 35-song rotation. They became the representatives of dance music, telling the unfamiliar masses; ""this is what dance music sounds like now."" Many of those songs went platinum and created even more impetus for labels and artists to maintain and nurture this formula, because at the end of the day it was making the most money. 


Dance music had been the backbone of my existence for 20 years to this point, there had been countless trends throughout the decades, many subgenres and sounds had come and gone, and I had morphed my own sound over those years as well. But it was time for me to do something different than I had been doing, something different than anybody else was doing, and something that would hopefully tip the scales against the soulless barrage of ""EDM."" Instead of just paying attention to the sound that was dominating the festivals and airwaves, I saw excitement with an undercurrent of, albeit rare, crossover dance music success that was happening simultaneously. To me it meant that a lot of people still wanted dance music that you could dance to, and that was what I wanted to make again. Sometime during the summer of 2013, I felt complete creative freedom after a considerable time without it. This came during the height of the climate-change in the industry and my personal aversion to the direction in which dance music as a whole was going. I think the feeling of freedom was so overwhelming and the time was just right that I kind of just said, ""fuck it, I'm gonna make whatever I feel like making from now on, there's no more walls."" 


There are certain elements of my music that I have always held onto as part of my identity as an artist, and elements that have come and gone, as I think is the case with most artists or musicians. My first goal when creating music is to make something that belongs in the future, not in the now. To interpret this literally; most albums take up to two years to make and up to another year to get released, so in a sense you have to think about how it will live in the future when creating. But nobody has a crystal ball. This is why I think of it in almost unrealistic terms; I'm trying to make music to be released three, five, even seven years from now, even though I know it will be released sooner than that. There's also the element of funk, soul, disco, and that whole era. I have a huge record collection of stuff from digging for samples when I was a kid, and that music had a huge influence on me. The amount of funk I've injected into my music and the way in which I inject it has cycled over the years, but it has always been there. When everything aligned, the ropes broke free and I had this musical, spiritual awakening type thing, and I knew exactly what I wanted to make. I wanted to make music people could dance to, with varying degrees of soul and funk, but done in a way it had never been done before. I wanted it to make people feel happy when they listened to it, and I wanted it to make me feel good too. 


The whole process has been scary, liberating, and an adventure in musical exploration. I've tried to figure out how to take the past and recreate it in it's true form but in the context of the future. I‚Äôve tried to make Electronic Dance Music that focuses on the Dance part and disregards the means of getting there. In the process I've disregarded the concept of what is expected of me by my fans and avid listeners and disregarded what is probably deemed safe in today's musical climate. But that's exactly what I wanted to do. To be safe is to be like everything else out there. I'm just trying to have a good time making an album of music that will inspire and make a lot of people happy.

Seeing Tiesto at Made in America motivated me to ask... you might want to listen for yourselves, but his transitions were awful and he was clearly just phoning it in up there. Probably not very bad overall, but underwhelming for a guy who has been doing it for so long.

9088,"Grew up on electronic, getting annoyed with all the cross genre blending. I don't want my girlfriends indie song in my electronic.","I'm like 3 mins into a very popular electronic podcast and it's some lady singing opera.  There is totally a time and place for this stuff in electronic and it's called after you build up to it.  Cross genre has been happening in electronic for A LONG TIME but this front end bullshit is getting annoying.  Long solo indie vocals w/no beat or the beat vol dropped way down.  if I wanted to listen to indie female vocal rock i totally have that SOMEWHERE ELSE in my music collection.

I put on a different podcast last night while cycling.  Stopped in this store and it was still playing in my pocket (via phone speaker).  If you didnt know better ud think it was my gf's favorite pop band or something else.  I had to turn it off because i was getting embarrassed.

While Im bitching, Im forever tired of the constant LONG talking breaks during podcast.  Not everyone does this so there's a way to do it right.  BBC essential mix is a great example, dada life is another.  No one is here to hear you go on and on bro.  give me the fucking music.

9092,Looking for certain EDM producers!,"Hey Everyone! 

My name is Damon, I'm a singer/ex-rapper who is moving on to a different form of lyrics. I've been working on a mixtape titled ""Elements"". The tape will consist of 4 songs with instrumentals not my own, 2 of which have been completed. My predicament is, I would like to offer a deluxe version of the tape with 3 additional songs from original instrumentals, thus allowing me to claim profit only from the deluxe version - an additional way to support the music.The genre of music I'm looking for is something Nu Disco/Pop/House/Rave/Electronica/EDM that has alot of creativity in the instrumental. The bands most similar to what I'm looking for is Mystery Skulls/ Miami Horror/ Capital Cities (Kangaroo court especially) 

I have previous stuff of mine on the internet which I archive on Souncloud but I don't want to post any links in the body paragraph lest I should upset mods (Same goes for my email but they'll be on my page). The things I've got on my channel are all raps however. If you are interested in hearing the two songs I've already completed for my mixtape, I'd be glad to show you  but please understand I don't want them to show up anywhere until the Mixtape's actual release :b

I Look forward to meeting with anyone who would like to help! I'm sure there are plenty of producers on here and I'd like to be acquainted with all of you!

&gt; It‚Äôs very important to show up to the festival wristband ready to avoid long lines and to ensure a stress-free Zoo experience. Our records indicate that you are almost there! You have validated your wristband and you have taken the steps to register it on the Intellipay system. Now you just need to load your wristband up with ‚ÄúEZ Bucks‚Äù. ****EZ Bucks is the official currency of Electric Zoo, and it will be the only currency accepted on-site for purchasing food, drinks, and merchandise. Because EZ Bucks is its own currency, it has a conversion rate: 9 EZ Bucks = $10 USD.**** Any remaining credit on your wristband will be refunded to you, subject to a $5 handling fee.
Bonus Incentive: If you add $100 to your wristband before midnight tonight, you will receive a 5 EZ Bucks bonus.bonus.

how great, $10 = 9 ezoo dollars, plus $5 handling fee. Not accepting cash.

Also they banned Camel/water Backpacks. I regret my decision for buying tickets.

9115,Ezoo Prediction,"So with the recent bans on waterbottles, camelbaks, and basically any form of personal hydration system that doesn't require you to refill every 15 minutes, I think there are going to be a lot of heat exhaustion/heatstroke incidents, which in turn will cause NYC to have another reason to deem it ""unsafe"" like last year. Maybe I'm just being pessimistic, but honestly how did Ezoo not think the whole hydration thing through? Reduction of a couple OD's is not worth the potential dozens of people passing out/overheating in similarly life-threatening manners. How about instead of putting the safety of every single fucking individual at risk by not allowing proper hydration at something as physically exerting as EDM concerts, they actually pat down/search people adequately? I'm willing to wait in a line an extra half hour to get in if it means I won't have to leave the stage area every half hour to refill a fucking 16oz waterbottle.

On a side note, for those that are going, or know the schedule, which sets are you looking forward to the most? Trying to play the who vs who game and set up my schedule, and still can't decide 100%.",EDM,1409264426,spitfire55,2,3,True,2014-08-28

9139,"""why do you love electronic music?""","What do I love about EDM? What makes it so special to me? Everyone asks these questions because they don't understand. But it's pretty simple. It's not because I want attention because EDM stands out, or anything like that. I love it because it's strange and unique. Like me. I feel my music is a reflection of who I am and what I've been through. Sometimes my music is soft and melodic, but sometimes it's hard and all over the place. But that's okay, because I don't really want it to flow all the time, because my life doesn't flow all the time. It's just my way of letting out pain and hurt, and joy and happiness. Sometimes I'm too shy or nervous to communicate it through words, so I make electronic sounds. It may seem strange to you, but to me, it's my everything. I mean, everyone needs to let out emotion in some way right? We're only humans. And it's also great because once you truly get inside of EDM, there are no stereotypes. I mean, when you're at a festival and you look out, there are all different kinds of people. That's what's amazing. There are no ""goths"", ""hipsters"", ""nerds"", or ""freaks"". Religion, race, sexual preference, none of it matters. Festivals are honestly just tons of completely different people coming together for the love of one thing. Electronic music. Whether it helped them with depression, inspired them to be themselves, or they love to blast it in their car, they all came to have a good time and vibe to the music. EDM shows you can be loud and stand out, and you don't always have to be the same. It's okay to stand out. Even though there are endless reasons, this is the main reason why I love it, and it's why it drew me near and made me interested in it in the first place. It's always going to be my life, and the only thing that will truly ever understand me. That's the best I can do to answer your question, I'm just speaking my heart. Thank you for reading.

9143,[Request] Help filling in a questionnaire about British Electronic Music in the '90s,"Hello /r/EDM
I am participating in the Edexcel Level 2 History qualification and as part of it I am required to gather some primary sources for an essay I have to write. I chose the topic of how the British Acid rave/ Summer of Love movement influenced modern day music. I was wondering if any fellow members would spare a moment of their time and answer a few questions to aid me in my work. Please can you try your hardest to answer the questions below and pm me with the answers if you can.

1) Do you think that British electronic music, produced in the '90s (House, Acid Rave, etc) has similar characteristics to modern Dance music (e.g. EDM, Dubstep, Electro-House, etc)?								
																
2)Do you think that British electronic music, produced in the '90s (House, Acid Rave, etc) has similar characteristics to modern popular non-exclusively electronic music (e.g. Pop, Metal, Alternative, etc)?								
								
3)Do you believe that modern commercial Pop has been influenced by '90s British House/ Rave in any way?								

4)Do you think '90s House/ Rave was produced with similar equipment as modern electronic music, if not state why?								
								
5)Do you think modern electronic music is produced as much/ to the same quality as '90s Rave/ House and why?								
								
6)Do you agree or disagree that modern 'DJ Shows' and music festivals (UMF, Tomorrowland, etc) are influenced by the rave scene that occurred in the Second Summer Of Love (Britain's rave scene in the '90s)?								
								
7)Do you believe that the taking of drugs at music festivals is due to the frequent taking of MDMA/Ecstacy in the Second Summer Of Love (Britain's rave Scene in the '90s)?

9155,"How long were you in the EDM ""scene""?","I just found this subreddit so it's nice to see some edm stuff going on in this site. Any plurlifers here? 

It seems like every 3-4 years, there is an influx of new ravers that get into the hype of edm events and the culture. My first year was 2010 when I was all into the scene as a freshman in college. After about three years I dropped off and only went to EDC Vegas or one or two other big events per year. A few reasons I think people eventually drop off is because EDM events and the culture can be pretty expensive and you eventually lose the luster of the culture through time. I don't want to say I'm jaded or anything. Some of the music that comes out now is still awesome, but big money has really influenced the culture compared to a few years ago (and even then, older ravers were pointing out the effects of EDM going mainstream). Nowadays, 21+ clubs with one headlining DJ are the tits. Way better and cheaper than going to Nocturnal or some major event.

So for any older ravers: how long were you big into the EDM scene? If you dropped off, why? ",EDM,1407972978,mikeymora21,0,1,True,2014-08-13

9160,"Maybe not the right sub for this, but something makes me kinda infuriated while I am looking at movies from Tomorrowland","Hi!

So as I am a HUGE fan of Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike (yeah yeah yeah I know they probably don't even produce or even live mix yeah yeah yeah) I was pumped for their full mainstage set and I loved it more than the last years which I also loved. Something that makes me kinda ""what-the-fuck-are-the-crowd-doing"" is that so many people don't jump. I'm only 17 and have only been to a few concerts, it being Nause and Avicii x2 and some others, so I really cant say I know how the atmosphere is at Tomorrowland simply because I am not old enough. 

What I do know is that you after a while gets really tired of jumping and raving. I get it. For me, and for a lot of my friends, it's a part of the package. It doesn't matter if you sweat a lot, it's not a date you're attending. It's a big fucking party.

Why do I always see on videos, people standing like on the front row, only to stand a bit nodding their heads and having their hands in front of them making some weird moves. 

I have an example here. They play a great song (absolutely love it actually) and it's easy to ""jump"" too (if there's a better word, let me know). You can see the whole front row just standing still. A few meters back, there's like three girls actually doing what I thought was the thing to do. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7sptEx0Ms#t=1060 (go to 18:28, I can't for some reason link directly to it). 

I don't sit here judging people. I am curious because for me, the crowds entertainment is just as important as the songs being played and how the DJ are. I was at my second Avicii concert in March and the first one a few years back was amazing. Close to the main stage and people were entertained. This time, far away as hell. People weren't entertained. People influence others it seems.

TLDR: Why are there people not even seeing to care about partying and raving and jumping at every drop like some other do? I don't think going to Tomorrowland is a great idea if you don't party that way. It might be warm and you're dehydrated, but I dont think THAT many is and it's also 18 minutes in the video.

I want it to be a place to discover and share new music that isn't afraid to push against the status quo of genres.

Does this sound interesting to you?  If it does, please stop by, subscribe, and share a few songs that you think are *hybrid*.  All I ask is that you follow the basic guidelines of tagging your posts appropriately.  

If you are interested in becoming a mod and watching this community grow, please let me know and we can work something out.  Be prepared to prove to me that you mean business, though.  I really think this subreddit could become a great community to find and share new music - all it needs is your help.

I will slowly be working on improvements and additions to the subreddit - it's pretty basic right now.  I have a few ideas up my sleeve but if you have any, please let me know.  I'm hoping that once it is up and running, having the tags will make it very easy for people to find songs and artists that they like.

9262,Compiled Blogs/News + Music streaming (something new?),"To begin, one of the submission rules:
7) IMPORTANT: NO personal websites

My site slightly falls underneath that category, but I think because it can potentially offer a refreshing and new way to find new music, it may merit an exception. 

The site I've been working on for months now is http://surfpl.com/#/tracks

Basically, you can ""post"" youtube videos and have them indexed be genres. It also has a ""Trending Articles"" page where it compiles the newest posts and articles from various big name EDM sites and sources (think mixmag, dancingastronaut, etc.)

For convenience, there's also a page called ""#SURF"" (stands for 'channelsurf') that lists a ton of the well-known youtube channels and shows the most recent 25 songs. This list was compiled using my personal favorites, and more importantly, along with the help of this excellent long list from /r/edmproduction: http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/1aigpd/what_are_some_good_youtube_channels_that_promote/

This is a little different than trying to find music through blog posts, where often times the site is very bloated and laggy due to having too much content crammed in your tiny browser window space :) I tried to build this project with a focus on a clean layout, and responsive user experience as a priority.

Very simply put, it just saves youtube data onto a database and presents it on a page to help you find new music easier. For an example of how the music player + playlists work, please check out http://surfpl.com/#/playlists/-JRRp53y3LH--5bJ1QaC and hit the ""play this playlist"" button.

What do you guys think? Is this something useable, and would you use it? Because I'm building this for the EDM community, it only makes sense to reach out and inquire for feedback from the community itself. 

Any comments, insight, critique will be taken very seriously :)",EDM,1406232304,rushfive,1,1,True,2014-07-24

I am going to VELD in Toronto this year and I am absolutely pumped about it. My problem though, is that I don't really know what to expect when I get there. From what I heard everyone is fucked up on M which is why everyone has the energy to dance and go crazy for two days straight. I've never done M before and the premise of buying pills off of random dudes at a concert sounds like a horrible idea to me. I'm most likely just going to get hammered all weekend long but my worry is that I will crash and burn if I just drink and dance all day long. Not to mention I don't want to have a wicked hangover for the second day leaving me unable to go ham again. Does anyone have any advice on how to keep going, I have a feeling that the typical ""just hydrate yourself"" won't cut it,  but I could be wrong. Like I said, I don't really know what to expect. I just don't want to spend all this money and have a shitty time because I can't keep up with my friends,  most of them  will be rolling. ",EDM,1404320177,[deleted],2,1,True,2014-07-02

9359,EDM/rave photographers: got a question for you,"You all know better than any other genre of photographer what's required to do the job (lighting is different for us, vs other photographers), so I figured I'd ask you.

I've been working as a professional in event/live music photography (*mostly* EDM stuff) for the past 5 years using a Canon Digital Rebel XT (8.1 megapixels), and a kit (18 - 55 mm) lens. It was my very first SLR, bought in 2006, and I've pushed it pretty much as far as it will go (which is a lot farther than most people seem to think). I also have a flash, but it's nothing special.

I've never looked into other equipment because I never had the money to buy it, so all I really know is what I've used so far. I may actually have the money soon though, so it's time to explore new stuff.

What bodies, lenses and flashes do you use, and what do you like about them? I'd also appreciate any sample images you could share, taken with the equipment you mention. I'm also particularly interested in DSLRs with good video capability. Been looking at the Canon 6D, but video samples from it seem a bit choppy.

9386,[Rant] EDM is music too.,"Im tired of everyone who doesn't listen to EDM saying that it's not ""music"". If it's not music, then what is it? Why do they play it on radio stations? Why do the artists perform at music festivals? Why are the songs on Itunes and Beatport and Soundcloud. Maybe it's not your type of music, or maybe it's just not what you're used to. But for many of us, Including me, it is. Some use the excuse, ""If you don't perform it live, it's not music.""
Bullshit.
And BTW, many acts DO perform it live. To name a few, Disclosure, Netsky, and The Bloody Beetroots.
There's also this one, which is hilarious, ""If there aren't any vocals, its not music."" HA.
Many rock bands, such as Van Halen, have instrumental songs, but nobody banished them for it, did they? And many EDM songs DO have vocals, and very good ones at that.
And, even though i'm not a HUGE fan of dubstep, it's sad to me to see how much hate and ridicule it recieves. Artists work very hard at producing it, only to recieve feedback such as ""Did you slam your face on the keyboard to make this?""
EDM has been there for me, and gotten me through some difficult times in my life, where all I had was music.
Recentely I listened to and old song, a favorite of mine, I had not heard in a while. It's called Love and War by Wolfgang Gartner.
I cried listening to it.
This song, this ""Electro-WUBstep"", this ""non-music"", this ""garbage"" invoked emotions that no other music could.
To me, this music represents Love and War. The song is beautiful, ugly, confusing, intense, violent, calm, uplifting, depressing, relatable, and overall a masterpiece.
While you ""music"" fans listen to your trashy, cliche pop songs, I will gladly listen to my beatiful, beatiful ""trash"".
Because this is what Love and War is all about.

But if there is anything ive learned from submitting my entry to this remix competition, its that most of the top 10 are producers who use their fan base to get them there.

Don't get me wrong, if they have done enough to obtain those fans in the first place i respect them %100, but looking through many of the submissions i noticed that there are much better remixes. 

Maybe other people have different views, but if i was in the position to host a remix contest, i would want to grant the golden prize to the most talented producer and most well mended remix. 

Ive tried my hardest to get my remix heard, and I'm not getting far. Maybe i just need to improve before i submit to these competitions.

I have created a subreddit dedicated to free parties.


For those who do not know, a free party is a literal free illegal rave normally based around Europe. Its a collection of people who listen to underground tekno/drum and bass with large rigs that are running of generators. Normal locations include; fields, warehouses and forests.


The reason for me creating this subreddit is because I feel that the people within this community would appreciate the subculture that is similar to the one of EDM.
Although it is more underground music, it's possible for you guys to enjoy our side of the EDM family. :)

""4x4=12"" had a meaning; he miscalculated once on a livestream.  So does While(1&lt;2) have any confirmed meaning?

I can only imagine it had to do with his breakup with Kat von D, and how he's alone now, so ""while 1 is less than 2,"" he's moving on. Thoughts?",EDM,1401303348,unlimitedpower6,4,1,True,2014-05-28

The problem is that it is a very scattered collection. It's missing some good party music (my personal preference is slightly more towards electrohouse, instead of the minimal / techno that is very popular in my group of acquaintances atm.)

So I was wondering if any of you could help me out with a nice list to get me started in the techno department. I'm pretty well up to date concerning techno and minimal, I just don't have any files. Is there a nice collection album I could go out and buy tomorrow? Or any torrentable lists (not sure if that's again this sub-reddit's rules)?

So, recap: I need some files to get me started. It's for a non-commercial party. I'll just be clicking some songs, nothing fancy. Pirating or buying, I'm up for both.

what should i do? it's still the presale. will more east general admission tickets be released tomorrow when tickets go on sale to the general public? because if that's the case, i can definitely get to my computer/phone at 10 am tomorrow morning. but i don't know how ticketmaster lots the tickets. i'm so torn.

9557,How to find EDM to your taste?,"Hello,

Good music is very subjective which is why I made a post about it - to selfishly  narrow it down to my taste but this is reddit so why not.
Secondly I think I might like EDM that is boringly mainstream and hopefully this might throw more suggestions my way which would be great since I am running out of music. So let her rip.

I enjoy EDM that compliments the vocals(mostly happening to be female), some examples, although ancient but you get the point, are:

Layer Cake Soundtrack - FC Kahuna Hayling (edited Mix)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j17e082fJgI

But if you have something interesting be it painfully overplayed or not then do link.





EDIT: 
Got some nice new tunes to listen to thanks to the guys on reddit and **I'm hoping there's plenty more where that came from** by people stumbling upon this post and wanting to share.

9595,What if Ultra Miami Does Move?,"Ultra 2014 sold maybe 80% of tickets and ended with questions about whether the festival was going to remain in Miami in 2015 after incidents involving the trampling of a security guard and death of a festival attendee. It was recently announced that Ultra 2015 will indeed stay in South Florida but the festival's future is still relatively uncertain. I think a move or expansion to another city appears inevitable at this point.

**1. Bigger EDM Market:** EDC Vegas 2014 sold out its 300,000+ tickets in a matter of days and provided a relatively simple ticket-buying experience. It was the fastest an EDM festival has ever sold out in the United States and left many people asking for more. On the other hand, Ultra Miami was accused of scamming hopeful attendees by promising an ""early bird"" ticket special wherein they promised a $150 ticket deal to those who bought tickets far enough in advance. 
As many may know, [that didn't go so well] (http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/crossfade/2013/05/ultra_2014_early-bird_tickets_sold_out.php) as thousands of people were left without tickets when prices jumped by hundreds of dollars in a matter of hours.
Ultra 2014  was ultimately a flop as tickets never sold out despite their all-ages policy (EDC is an 18+ event) and highly funded festival promotions. 


**2. Possible Locations:** Miami is known as one of the top party cities in the U.S. and has long time been the crux of EDM in North America. While parting ways with Ultra's original home would indeed be difficult, there are a few cities that could make great candidates for the festival's new host. 
Aside from Miami, other major EDM hotspots in the U.S. include Las Vegas, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, and San Diego.

Neither Vegas or New York stand out as likely options seeing that both cities already have their own major EDM festivals in EDC Vegas and Electric Zoo NY. 

It's improbable that Los Angeles adopts a major EDM festival back into their city after EDC L.A. 2011 resulted in the deaths of multiple ravers due to drug overdoses. 
Chicago could emerge as a frontrunner for Ultra's new home given its consistent demand for EDM and relatively small amount of dance music festivals in the city (Spring Awakening and EDC Chicago both could be overpowered with the arrival of Ultra). However, Ultra takes place in late March, when the Windy City is still emerging from its harrowing winter season. An outdoor festival does not seem likely in Chicago's late March conditions. 
Detroit is considered by many to be the origin of house music but I think we all know [why Ultra won't be there any time soon] (http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2013/10/22/detroit-again-tops-list-of-most-dangerous-cities-but-crime-rate-dips/).

**San Diego**, to me at least, seems to be the most reasonable option for a future relocation. Located at the Southern tip of California and mere miles from the Mexican border, San Diego is essentially a reflection of Miami. Its numerous nightclubs and venues make it an EDM-rich area and one of the faster growing cities in the dance music scene. Its current lack of major electronic music festivals creates an obvious desire for the addition of one in the area. With EDC Vegas only one state away, ticket sales would go smoother than ever as California's vast population is divided comfortably between EDC and Ultra leaving room for thousands of out of the area revelers plenty of time to buy tickets before prices extend to unreasonably high levels.

Every one in a while he will throw in the 16th note pattern with accents.  All of this while marking time to the groove.  Towards the end of the video he was walking up on a whole drum set but then I had to go to work.

As a back-up, does anyone have something I may be able to use? The University would want to upload a copy of the video (with your song) to their youtube channel as well as show it at Uni to future students. You could also upload the video to your channel if you wanted and if I used your track.

This is just a precaution, please let me know if you want anymore details :)

P.S This is a repost as the people that volunteered, although awesome music, were not quite what I was requiring for the tone of the animation. It's kind of hard to say as I don't know much about music but when I hear it I will know it! Thanks

9639,I can't hate Ti√´sto and his music.,"If you listen to even the slightest amount of EDM, you probably know who the hell Tiesto is. This funny-looking, European guy being one of electronic music's greatest producers and DJs known to the world. That being said, now these days it seems Tiesto just panders to whatever is new and the general thought towards his music from electronic music junkies is that it's just straight up awful. 

However, as a big fan of electronic music, I can't hate this guy. Maybe because his music is what opened me to electronic music but no matter how much crap is said about the guy, I simply do not hate him or his music. 

I honestly can say without a doubt that even if Tiesto released a song of him just making an drop out of a deuce he took, I still would probably listen to it. I have no clue why I like his music so much. Even if his sets and tracks are bland, I still listen the hell out of them. I didn't care when he shifted from trance to house. I love his album Kaleidoscope. I had no fucks given when it was revealed he had ghost producers (I mean he has the ideas, they just produce them). Heck, I even support him mixing deep house on his radio show. Why the hell do I like Tiesto so much? Why can't I hate Tiesto?

Edit: I just realized, Tiesto is kinda like the Adam Sandler of the EDM world. No matter how bad his song and mixes are, people will still buy into them just because it's Tiesto (I know I'm guilty).",EDM,1398387416,SaadLulz,8,11,True,2014-04-24

9665,New sub for music &amp; artist discovery: /r/electronicreleases. More inside.,"It's come to my attention recently that I'm not the only one who dislikes seeing age-old tracks reposted in the music subs. Subreddits that feel like they should be about the newest releases end up feeling cluttered by older tracks that people are ""just discovering"" (despite them being released &gt;6 months ago). 

With that in mind, I figured it was time to create a sub to actually fulfill this purpose so people like me can stop our fucking whinging in the main subreddits. This is why I've created /r/electronicreleases, to make it easier for music lovers to stay on top of new releases within the scene.

I'm hoping we can make that sub a good place to listen to and discuss new tracks so that places like /r/EDM can stay as they are without the interference of us closet hipsters. 

**If you want to check it out and help contribute, head on over to /r/electronicreleases and give it a look. Maybe post a track or two, and let's talk about how we can create the best platform so that everyone can stay updated with the least effort.**",EDM,1397830900,iKill_eu,1,6,True,2014-04-18

PLM had a showcase set called the PLM Party and all on stage at once were Derek himself for Pretty Lights, Michal Menart, Supervision, Paul Basic, Elliot Lipp and a few others. It was a small stage so it made for a real intimate venue which was awesome so after the set Derek and the guys stayed around for a little fan interaction. He was signing autographs and taking selfies with girls on their phones when I handed him my PL jiberish hat and he immediately said ""Oh shit, the blue and gray one, this ones the coolest."" The thought of a trade immadiately popped into my head after he made that comment so I asked him to trade me my PL hat for his personal Yankees 59fifty hat.

9680,"Fuck me for wanting to go dance however I want, without judgement.","Just a rant. TL:DR people are so fucking ignorant. 
 

Last May my city was one of the lucky ones to see Bassnectar play, and it was amazing. Much to my chagrin, my excitement on Facebook was met by the majority (if not all) of my ""metalhead"" friends bitching/whining/complaining. Mainly about how it ""takes no talent"" to be a DJ. One guy in particular peeved me off. Cause he's in a band. A metal band that really isn't anything to dote on, but thinks they're heavens on earth with their music. As a musician, you should have respect for any fellow musician. From the country singers, to the rappers, from the pop punk bands that annoy you, to the DJs with ""no talent"".


Fast forward to today. I was looking to find someone to go with to a local dive bar to see a couple DJs that I have no idea about. One was even in from the UK. Looked up their music, it's meh. But guess what? It would be fun anyways I'm sure.

A couple comments made and posts about how ""no good music comes around"" and ""EDM is so stupid"". 

I may not like every genre, but why make rude/annoying/ignorant comments every time a concert/show comes around that I don't like.Especially when you are a fucking ""adult"". Take your childish trash talk elsewhere.


Cause you know what's the best part about EDM? I can go to a show, fucked up as hell, or sober as hell. End up meeting the friendliest people from all over the place, and dance without any care. I don't have to worry about knowing the songs, I don't even have to like to DJ for that matter. I can simply just go and have a magical fucking time moving my body, and dancing as cool or as awkwardly as I want!

9703,Ultra 2014 getting too commercial (Opinion),"Don't get me wrong, I love Ultra.  Sadly, the festival wasn't really as joyful as it was before.  I didn't buy a ticket this year, so I don't have too much to say but watching from the live stream, it kept reoccurring to me that Ultra got really annoying with advertising itself.
For example:
""Go on your phones and HASHTAG ""ULTRA2014""

No hate, but the live stream kept emphasizing how much people were loving Ultra.  The hosts of the live stream kept dodging or evading topics about music and tried to switch the topic to how big they thought Ultra was to artists like Armin and Afrojack.

I get it, they want to make Ultra one of those special moments, but personally, it's getting annoying.  Tickets to this thing have skyrocketed and all they do is advertise people to constantly tell everyone about it while they only have a limited amount of space in Miami.  I'd say the festival has grown worldwide but the main event hasn't improved since last year.  I was constantly asking what the hell happened to phase 2.  Then someone finally told me there was no weekend 2 anymore.

While talking about this to a buddy, he kinda disagreed. And seconds after that, his opinion changed when some member of the crowd on the livestream said ""I'm lovin Ultra baby!  Woo!""

I'm not saying I don't like Ultra, I love the music.  But the company is pushing it too hard trying to make it worldwide.

Its not particularly my type of music but I won tix and love going to shows. They had a pretty good light show but their visuals they had in the back ground were really weird. In the first couple songs they had bright vibrant colors with clips of protests and cheeseburgers. Which I got what they were going for, a kinda of how fucked up or society is thing. Yet it's almost was so pretty it almost glamorized it. Then they had the usual third eye chakra, new age, hippy dippy images and within those crosses. Like Catholicism jeses crosses. It felt like almost subliminal images. I felt like I was listen to Christian music at church.  It freaked my boyfriend and I out so much we had to leave. Anyways i don't know where I was going with this but I guess I'm just sharing my experience. Maybe I was being paranoid. Anyone been to a papadosio show and notice this?

9733,Am I an inner EDM asshole?,"Awhile ago, this kid I follow on Instagram posted a picture of the cover art of Avicii's new album ""True"". He commented under his post ""Hey Brother BEST SONG EVER! Keep in mind, literally no one I follow on Instagram listens to EDM. For some reason, this post really pissed me off. This kids musical taste is everything pop, he even knows the lyrics to the newest pop songs. So I know for a fact, that BJ (an appropriate name to protect his identity), listened to this on the radio and decided it was his new favorite song. It always irks me when someone goes and says their favorite song is by an artist they barely know or have ever heard of before. And, what really gets me mad is that ""Hey Brother"" isn't even that good! It's good, but it's not ""BEST SONG EVER"" good. But that wasn't even the tipping point. I got really pissed off when he and this girl started typing the lyrics to the song in the comments like complete tools. I listened these songs literally the day they came out and I said ""eh"". Three months later, everyone is losing their shit. It feels good to get that out.

It also IRKS me when I go on VEVO and go their Emerging Artists page and Avicii is on there. Avicii is NOT an emerging artist. He's been dominating the dance charts for almost three years now. So don't go say that because you liked ""Wake Me Up"" and is on the radio, that Avicii is an upcoming artist.

So I've been listening to EDM on and off now, but it's hard for me to find new songs that I really love. I really enjoy progressive trance (I think that's what its called) and don't enjoy dubstep that much. 

I wanted to see if you guys could recommend me some new artists/songs to listen to. Just to give a little bit more background on my music taste, I like songs that are relaxing and not in your face with the bass. I'm pretty bad at describing what I like, but some of my favorite songs are [Strobe by Deadmau5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKi9Z-f6qX4), [The Night Out by Martin Solveig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n-_9ZjwRC4), [Technicolor by Madeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vois0RMtPHE) and a new favorite I just found, [Until the End by Dirty South](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOHt4l0IYck).

9763,The Power of Electronic Music,"tl:dr - I'm new to producing, I have seen the power of music. Is it what the producer does or the peoples interpretation?

I have been a fan of EDM forever but I have just begun to mess around and learn about producing. What I have experienced with EDM is shown well in the majority of After Movies from festivals but Only if you've been will you understand. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUhPA5qIxDQ)- tomorrowland

I have also had a few things happen while listening to music that were more than coincidence. listening to hey you by pink floyd I threw something at my friend with absolutely no reason but his reaction was singing  ""hey you"" and it all lined up right on time with the singer.

obviously if you understand music and how it works, the timing makes sense because even those songs have build-ups in the verse up to the chorus. I was still astounded at the power that song had. 

What I want as a producer is, I'm sure, what every other producer not obsessed with money wants. I want to put out music that makes people go absolutely insane (with happiness, not a riot) at shows.

I love when songs do unexpected things like wait 2 measures instead of one for the drop (https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=708608342493243 - this link is on Visionaires fb page so I don't know if you'll have to like his page first, sorry if you do). But I also love it when an entire audience knows whats coming and basically all do the same thing. 

Now we're about to get weird. Everyone always jumps and goes crazy on the drop but is there a way through the music to get people to do things a certain way. I know that dancing is an individual's interpretation of the music but just as companies have been doing with subliminal messaging is it possible to subliminally dictate an audience's dancing? 

I am not trying to be creepy or anything. My favorite part of EDM is the global community and if there was a way; through my productions that I could make it even tighter knit, or add deeper sense of familiarity to it... That is my goal. ",EDM,1394645860,tax9962,1,0,True,2014-03-12

Now this doesn't happen everywhere but I have noticed that not everyone is all ""peace, love and unity"" at most events lately. It may be because I am not a girly girl, and dress like a boy, but I have been to a bunch of events where people were being straight up assholes... I mean I will be in a crowd enjoying music, and people, especially other guys will start leaning on me, or elbowing me, as if trying to get me to leave... A couple of weeks ago i have definitely had a drink thrown on me as well as an object (could have been a cup) thrown at my head at Revel in AC. Last year at EZOO I was alone in a crowd and have been elbowed and pushed from every corner. I have always been the one to stand up for myself but I am not stupid and I won't pick a fight with a group of 5-10 big dudes... But seriously it hurts and I have almost lost interest in going to my favorite type of events... Has this happened to anyone else? And to people who have done this, why do you do it?

9788,(Discussion) The Current Direction of EDM,"I'd like to start a discussion on the idea that, not only is EDM changing, as music does, but it's heading in a very positive direction. Just on r/EDM alone today, we notice things like [Porter Robinson's Sea of Voices](https://soundcloud.com/porter-robinson/sea-of-voices) and the [Ultra 2014 Official Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1TXerJiIrI), both featuring EDM music that isn't what was popular over the past few years. We can even look at Avicii's TRUE album, which features songs that, while they are still upbeat and danceable, contain large amounts of production, far exceeding the standard 'House"" music style of production. Just dropping big names for argument sake, even Afrojack and Skrillex have moved away from club bangers and screaming dubstep drops, and started seriously kicking up their production skills and creating EDM music that is made to enjoy, not just rave too. 

Does everyone here like the idea that EDM may be becoming less rave centered, and more of a listen-to-at-home sound? Or do people think it should stick to a more segregated scene, and keep it the way it is/was with a mix of huge festival music, and underground rave music? Or is there a happy medium we are looking for, between artists producing enough music to keep dancers happy, while satisfying people who just enjoy the sound of EDM? Or is the production quality shown in the music produced over the past few years what everyone would like to see more of? What does everything think?

Note: I'm saying 'over the last few years' to be about club bangers, modern house and modern trance era music. I'm trying to avoid the '90's trance and hardstyle' discussion here, and keep it to where EDM is currently going. ",EDM,1394011388,[deleted],27,15,True,2014-03-05

9805,My thoughts after performing my first gig.,"I just got back from my first show, I was on the bill with about 5 other artists at a venue in Portland.

A few days ago I wrote a post asking for some advice, and I just thought I'd evaluate how it went, and maybe how someone else could prepare for their first show.


--------------------
1) The sound guy was a dick. The person in charge of making sure all of the levels are in balance, was a massive dick. I don't know if this is a common thing, but it really made the experience super unpleasant.

2) You meet a lot of people. If you are trying to decide wether or not you should go perform your first gig (no matter what genre), do it if only for meeting new people. Everyone is very welcoming and nice, and you will make connections way faster than through the internet.

3) People leave, fast. I didn't realize how quickly the venue becomes deserted, I chose the 10:50 timeslot and hardly anyone was there. But, if you are afraid you will suffer from stage-freight, it might be a good idea to perform a little later.

4) Have fun, focus on the music. Even though you may feel a little bit awkward at first, no one in the crowd will feel inclined to dance, unless you are, and you're having a good time! Focus on the music and jump and dance!

5) I probably won't perform again. I am very glad I went and performed, but I learned that I don't prefer being on a stage. So, again, if you are on the fence trying to decide wether or not to go and have your first gig. Do it, if only to learn that you don't prefer it!

--------------------
That's about all I can think of right now! Sorry if some of this is not understandable, It's 12:30 am and I'm really tired.
I hope this can help some people out, and if there is anyone that has their first gig soon and has some questions, Feel free to ask me!

**UPDATE:**
Through connections I made through my first gig, I got offered to open for BassHunter when he comes to Portland! Just another reason to do your first gig: it gets your name out there.

This is the email from RedCubePDX

Please read... It makes my heart heavy and support is what it's all about.


Hi everyone,

As some of you might have already heard, my long time partner and friend Jayson Burnham, aka AJ, passed away on Friday 2.07 in his sleep from a heart-attack.  As you can imagine, it's been a very difficult time here for the Red Cube family.

Besides just leaving behind a vast group of people who cared deeply for him, AJ also left behind his daughter, Akira, a beautiful and bright little girl.  Because AJ was such a good friend and meant so much, and because I know how important to him the future of his little girl would be, I'm attempting to raise funds for this little angel by organizing a benefit in her name at which we'll also be selling t-shirts that memorialize AJ.  Absolutely 100% of these proceeds will go to a trust-fund account that has been set up in Akira's name, in an effort to ensure her the future that AJ would have wanted.

The link for the benefit event that we're organizing can be found here: [Link](http://bit.ly/ajpanda)

I am reaching out because any contribution, no matter how small, will be of great benefit and hugely appreciated.  Every little bit helps, and every little bit goes that much further into ensuring that bright future for such a special little girl.

You can help here: [Link for Akira](http://bit.ly/forakira)

9876,Krome Angels release long awaited second album.,"KromeAngels have risen to a new level. The trio, who have been a watchword for dance innovation, amazing global parties and vast musical talent throughout the last two decades are not content to rest on their laurels, but are as hungry for new musical experience as they ever have been. 

These three veterans of the scene, who had always been full of respect for one another's music, first joined forces as KromeAngels back in 2006. Only now, though, have they matured into an album act, with their aptly-titled debut 'Modern Day Classics' currently making waves worldwide and their second album 'Sexy, Freaky, Nasty' and preceding singles featuring rave legends MC Darrison and Sian Evans (Kosheen) ready to cement their position as international electronic music titans.

But who are they? This mighty sonic triumvirate comprises Brighton-born Dino Psaras (the first Dragonfly DJ, the first person to release on the Perfecto Fluoro label and member of Cydonia and Ayahusca); Dado (the renowned French music producer who has collaborated with the likes of Bamboo Forest and spearheaded projects such as Transwave); and Shanti (whose infamous basslines made him the young prodigy of the Voov Festival, and who composed the Visionquest 2003 DVD signature tune).

None of them were ever content to settle into predictable grooves, and recognising kindred spirits who refused to stagnate into any kind of trance ‚Äúnorm‚Äù, these three came together to create a fresh sound, taking the genre to new realms encompassing breakbeat, techno, house, electro and everything in between.

Despite all this history though, this is really just the beginning. They are ready to explode in all directions ‚Äì as if 'Sexy, Freaky, Nasty' wasn't enough, a third, live, album covering the incendiary best of their early years will follow in its footsteps.

9919,SoCal vs NYC EDM Scene - Need Help,"fellow /r/edm redditors, i need your help. 
I'm moving from orange county, ca to manhattan, ny in a few weeks and was curious about the EDM scene in NYC. I am very familiar and absolutely love the scene in socal. I've seen every major DJ at every major club in LA/HW (create, exchange, sound, sutra, etc), SD, and Vegas as well as all the festivals (edc, coachella, tao, hard, etc) I never took for granted how many awesome shows and festivals were going on at any given weekend in socal (and the surrounding areas) so I'm bummed to leave. However, i'm pretty happy to be moving to NYC and was curious if anybody here knows BOTH scenes so they can provide some commentary to help me figure out where to go for shows and what spots to avoid. If not, i would also like people's opinions on the NYC venues and suggestions on where to go for good shows.

My favorite spot in LA is definitely Create so I will use this place as a reference point. I went to Marquee for Hook n Sling last week and also went to this club called phD on some rooftop. I thought Marquee was kind of lame, nobody really knew who hook n sling was, nobody danced, people were not as good looking as those in LA, and there were no plur vibes, for lack of a better term. People were just there raging and doing blow, which I'm not judging. Im just used to places where people know the DJ, know about house/electronic music, and are a lot more friendlier.  PhD was also nothing to write home about. No interest in the DJ or music. So i'm a NYC newbie and don't know a lot of places. I know Lavo, Pacha, Webster Hall, and Marquee regularly have EDM DJs that play there. I've also been told Brooklyn has a scene but also lots of pretentious hipsters so avoid that part of town. 

So tell me where to go and describe these venues. I'm looking for a more knowledgeable scene. I'm into most EDM, deep house, trance, trap, dub step, i pretty much have an appreciation for it all. So help me out. Thanks guys.

9926,Can anyone suggest a media player that supports multiple artists.,"Before i got into EDM, music that had multiple artists was a little frustrating in iTunes but I got around this by just including a (feat SoAndSo) in the title of the song. 

IE: 

Title: The Monster (feat Rihanna)
Artist: Eminem
Album Artist: Eminem 

etc.

However the more I get into EDM, the more I am discovering that this simply does not work. For instance I am currently listening to a track called Wild Out, done originally by Borgore, featuring Waka Flocka Flame and Paige, but remixed by Boots N' Pants.

Currently in iTunes the only way I can make this work out is:

Title: Wild Out (feat Waka Flocka Flame &amp; Paige) (Boots N' Pants Remix)
Artist: Borgore; Waka Flocka Flame; Paige; Boots N' Pants
Album Artist: Boots N' Pants

By setting Album Artist to Boots N' Pants, it sorts the song appropriately under Boots N' Pants in my iTunes and iPod but I would really like the song to ALSO appear in my library under Borgore so that if I look up songs by him it will play there as well. 

I do not want to create a duplicate of every song with a different Album Artist for Each. 
I do not want to have to create Smart Playlists for every artist I want to find. 
Searching for Borgore without the ; won't show this song.


Does anyone know how to organize the iTunes library to access songs with different artists from each artists name or if not can you suggest a media player that does this, can sync with an iPod, and can be controlled remotely via an android app like my iTunes can?

9930,State of the Community,"EDM in general has been progressing to an awful, commercialized and incredibly, dangerously boring place for the disgusting purposes of maximum profit over the last 5 years, especially the last few years.
To me when I hear some of the new, popular headliners it just sounds like boring pop music structures clad in a thin veneer of stolen and previously used electronic sounds - and it's offensive to my ears.
It's about as pleasant or rewarding to me as listening to the demo tracks on a cheap department store keyboard.
It really has let the ""barbarians"" in the gate. Dumbass dudebros that don't actually care about the music, and who only care about raging and getting drunk, high and/or laid. They might as well be at a Nickelback or DMB concert drinking overpriced light domestic beer out of tiny plastic cups.
It's turned the concept of PLUR into a mockery of itself and is used as a defense for the bad behavior of assholes who think sexual objectification, abuse or sexism is ok, and it's ""unplurry"" to call assholes on their bullshit taker/destructive behavior. (Fuck everything about that.)
Too much money is involved.
Thankfully there's still tons of good artists left making good new music whether it's underground or local or quiet artists that don't care about fame or gold records, people who would happily tell commercials, movies and the Grammy awards to fuck off.
If I may digress - I heard about when Insomniac first started throwing parties in LA around 1996. I heard about  the first poster-sized fliers and excessive promotional gimmicks and bullshit. They'd promise all kinds of crazy shit like free water or carnival/festival rides and then totally fail to deliver any of it for what was then unheard of 20, 30 and 40 dollar ticket prices. (Most raves back then were either free, donation based or like $5 to $10. Maybe $15 if someone big was coming in from out of town.)
Insomniac did more to single-handedly wreck the LA underground dance music scene in a couple of years than the LAPD did in almost 10 years. They burned up a bunch of previously safe locations with their lack of self control and self policing. Their parties got busted all the time by full troops of LAPD riot cops, complete with trapping party-goers in blind alleys and shooting them with rubber bullets and pepper spray and literally beating the shit out of peaceful people with their clubs and shields.
Little did I know that they were just getting started with taking from the underground music scenes and putting that stolen money straight into their pockets.
I go to small local shows, some of them underground. I've been to at least one genuine warehouse party this year and a couple of renegades. 
There is still good new music out there, but you're not going to find it at the commercial festivals like EDC that people are mistakenly calling ""raves"" at this point. You're not going to find it on Mixmag, or Pandora, either. You might be able to find it on YouTube or Soundcloud, but you'll have to dig for it.
The only reason why I'm so angry about it and invested in it is because it pisses me off to see people - especially young ravers who don't know any better - getting ripped off and lied to. They could be spending their money on better parties, better DJs and even maybe better drugs.
Sure, you can have fun at a safe and large commercial dance music festival where they actually charge you money for water. But I promise you that you could be having a lot more fun somewhere else, for less money, while directly supporting local artists and smaller promotional crews.
They could actually experience something real like I once did, and maybe it would change their lives like it changed mine - so they realized and learned important things about life. Like what you wear or buy isn't important. And that how you treat other human beings is the most important thing of all.
And that there's much more to ""raving"" and life itself than just buying a uniform (like fun fur, day glow disposable ""raver gear"" made in China, etc) and fitting in and doing the same thing as everyone else.
That kind of shit isn't ""unity"" any more than buying the same socks at the mall is unity.
It might be too political or too idealistic but ""ravers"" used to think we could actually dance our way to a better future and change the world. Maybe we still can, but it's just not going to happen through tickets bought through Goldenvoice or Ticketmaster at a party where everyone is wearing the exact same day-glow hats and cheap-ass blinky sunglasses imported from China.
That's just crass consumerism and disposable culture, and the powers that be obviously love and approve of it. Because it's just the same old bullshit they've always been selling, just on a different day under a different label.
So, no. We're not comparing today's decline to that pop crap. We're comparing it to real, underground and renegade parties right here in the states, some of it recent enough that it happened just last month - where the music can be free and innovative. Where the music is what the DJ actually wants to play, not where the DJ is playing a carefully selected list of songs designed for mass appeal and selling the most tickets.",EDM,1391139657,[deleted],0,1,True,2014-01-30
9931,EDM and Raves nowadays...,"I've been listening to EDM since 2006. I started off with Trsnce, Hardstyle and Happy Hardcore and i can honestly say that EDM in general has been progressing to an awful, commercialized and incredibly, dangerously boring place for the disgusting purposes of maximum profit over the last 5 years, especially the last few years.

To me when I hear some of the new, popular headliners it just sounds like boring pop music structures clad in a thin veneer of stolen and previously used electronic sounds - and it's offensive to my ears.
It's about as pleasant or rewarding to me as listening to the demo tracks on a cheap department store keyboard.
It really has let the ""barbarians"" in the gate. Dumbass dudebros that don't actually care about the music, and who only care about raging and getting drunk, high and/or laid. They might as well be at a Nickelback or DMB concert drinking overpriced light domestic beer out of tiny plastic cups.
It's turned the concept of PLUR into a mockery of itself and is used as a defense for the bad behavior of assholes who think sexual objectification, abuse or sexism is ok, and it's ""unplurry"" to call assholes on their bullshit taker/destructive behavior. (Fuck everything about that.)
Too much money is involved.

Thankfully there's still tons of good artists left making good new music whether it's underground or local or quiet artists that don't care about fame or gold records, people who would happily tell commercials, movies and the Grammy awards to fuck off.

If I may digress - I heard about when Insomniac first started throwing parties in LA around 1996. I heard about  the first poster-sized fliers and excessive promotional gimmicks and bullshit. They'd promise all kinds of crazy shit like free water or carnival/festival rides and then totally fail to deliver any of it for what was then unheard of 20, 30 and 40 dollar ticket prices. (Most raves back then were either free, donation based or like $5 to $10. Maybe $15 if someone big was coming in from out of town.)
Insomniac did more to single-handedly wreck the LA underground dance music scene in a couple of years than the LAPD did in almost 10 years. They burned up a bunch of previously safe locations with their lack of self control and self policing. Their parties got busted all the time by full troops of LAPD riot cops, complete with trapping party-goers in blind alleys and shooting them with rubber bullets and pepper spray and literally beating the shit out of peaceful people with their clubs and shields.
Little did I know that they were just getting started with taking from the underground music scenes and putting that stolen money straight into their pockets.
I go to small local shows, some of them underground. I've been to at least one genuine warehouse party this year and a couple of renegades. 

There is still good new music out there, but you're not going to find it at the commercial EDM festivals like EDC that people are mistakenly calling ""raves"" at this point. You're not going to find it on Mixmag, or Pandora, either. You might be able to find it on YouTube or Soundcloud, but you'll have to dig for it.
The only reason why I'm so angry about it and invested in it is because it pisses me off to see people - especially new ravers who don't know any better - getting ripped off and lied to. They could be spending their money on better events, better DJs and even maybe better experiences.
Sure, you can have fun at a safe and large commercial EDM festival where they actually charge you money for water. But I promise you that you could be having a lot more fun somewhere else, for less money, while directly supporting local artists and smaller promotional crews.
They could actually experience something real like I once did, and maybe it would change their lives like it changed mine - so they realized and learned important things about life. Like what you wear or buy isn't important. And that how you treat other human beings is the most important thing of all.
And that there's much more to ""raving"" and life itself than just buying a uniform (like fun fur, day glow disposable ""raver gear"" made in China, etc) and fitting in and doing the same thing as everyone else.

10003,EDM Production Schools | My Problem With Them.,"One thing I am really starting to hate about the EDM World (Yeah, I know. Surprising) is that all the EDM Production schools I've looked at only implement Ableton and Logic Pro into their ""academy"".

This is starting to bug me, because I use FL Studio to produce and It's pretty solid base for me. But, I would like to be able to go to a school / college that implements FLS in their courses, so I am able to learn how to use a DAW more in-depth with familiarity.

I am planning to learn FLS more in-depth on my own over the course of 2014. But, I would also like to learn more than what I may know by then in a school.

I also don't know. Maybe, by the end of 2014, I will know most of everything to know about FLS. In that case scenario, I will then experiment with Ableton. A lot of producers and some of my friends use it, so I can get some tips with them.

If I don't like it or it has been deemed to be too complicated for me to use, I will switch back to FLS.

All I really want at the moment is to be able to find a EDM Production school / college that implements FLS in their courses, so I can have something to look forward to.

EDIT: I have figured out the problem. People don't take FLS as seriously as Ableton or Logic as a Production Software. Such a shame.",EDM,1388070648,TheOfficialJWOK,5,0,True,2013-12-26

Anyway, Make a Wish just posted its wishes its trying to grant in time for xmas. this one caught my eye     
&gt;This 17-year-old has always been very passionate about music, so she has made a wish for her very own DJ equipment! She looks forward to making her own music and has hopes of one day becoming a professional DJ. After treatment for leukaemia and granting this wish before Christmas would be such a wonderful surprise.    

So I got onto pioneer and we have got her a DDJ-WeGo, ive chucked in my Steve Aoki signed Sol headphones (still boxed) and will be getting her some lessons. Come march 2014, she will perform main stage alongside of the acts i mentioned earlier. The full 9 yards, a town car will pick her up, she will be assigned a dressing room and a tour manager.

* Remind the crowd that this is the exciting part of the by cutting out the music entirely and saying something like ""OK GET READY GUYS IM ABOUT TO PLAY THE HEAVIER PART OF THE SONG SO YOU ALL KNOW WHAT TO DO...""

""OK""

""ARE YOU READY""

""OK""

""HERE IT COMES""

""IM GONNA DO IT NOW""

* Raise your hand in the air and pretend like you are literally holding the beat and are about to drop it onto your audience. Smile so they know that you aren't trying to hurt them.

* Add a loud kick drum and couple it with chainsaws, birds, traffic noises, airhorns, bubbles, lazers, really whatever you feel like. Be careful with lazers because the crowd might think you are trying to hurt them. Smile again so they know its cool.

The whole crowd is going to dribble some imaginary basketballs for about 30 seconds. Just be a good sport about this and let them do it.

* Stop that nonsense and bring in a breakdown, with an ethereal female vocalist singing about how this night better last forever. The crowd will all become very introspective and emotional. Everyone will abruptly stop dancing. This is fine.

While the women are distracted singing along, then men will continue to search for ones who look like they wouldn't mind a nice clothed penis brushing against their backside.

* Repeat steps 1-7 40x without ever changing the tempo

10107,Teach a noob about EDM!,"I apologize in advance for not knowing the correct terms and probably making an ass out of myself by asking stupid questions.  

A couple of nights ago I went to a friend's birthday party. She is fairly popular and goes to raves and stuff all the time.  Anyways, I am kinda the odd one in her group of friends.  I'm a metalhead and I'm quite proud of it.  Long hair, beard, and black shirts galore.  (Imagine [Johan S√∂derberg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Amon_Amarth-0962-Johan_S%C3%B6derberg.jpg) from Amon Amarth with 20 fewer years on him.)  

So, I walk into the place that she rented for her party and I immediately realize that I stand out like... well... like a metalhead at a club.  Everyone is dancing and I have no clue what to do.  I grab a beer and find a couch and sit down.  This song comes on and everyone clears out this area in the middle of the room and 3 guys jump in and start jumping up and down and swinging their legs around and spinning in unison.  It was hypnotic.  The throbbing of the bass put me into a trance and I noticed that I was halfway headbanging to the music.  I sat on that couch for a good hour just listening to the music before my friend pulled me into the back for some cake and pizza.  

Ever since that night, Ive been trying to learn about EDM and Ive realized that Ive got no clue what I am doing lol.  All of the subgenres sound the same and I have no clue how to differentiate a good artist from a bad artist.  Not to mention that I don't understand the culture surrounding EDM nearly as well as I understand metal culture.

I am in pursuit of a specific song for a short video we are doing. What this song NEEDS to include:

-A melodic feel

-A heavier breakdown, within ~1:30 minute of the track that turns into...

10127,This is my life,"I am a 16 year old male living un the United States. This is my life basically. I hate my life. I don't know why but I do. there are only few moments when I actually enjoy life. When I‚Äôm with her, and when I‚Äôm in my element. I don't think I‚Äôm depressed, I think I just irrationally hate my life for reasons I‚Äôm sort of unsure of. I don't play the part though. On the outside I‚Äôm that good little kid who my whole family appreciates. I‚Äôm that kid in at school who doesn't say a word in one class but is the most talkative in the next one. I‚Äôm the kid who people judge for some reason. I hear of other people who are for some reason deemed cool say bad things about me when I don't even know them. I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm writing this, what I‚Äôm going to do with it, or where my ideas are going, i‚Äôm just writing out my thoughts. I‚Äôm supposed to be doing my homework but for other reasons I don't understand everything but my homework is on my mind. Maybe i have really bad ADD, I don‚Äôt know. All I know is that for the past 2 hours I was supposed to read a one page article and analyze it but I haven‚Äôt finished reading it or even written down the first question. Because every 5 minutes I rationalize a reason to do something else. I think I‚Äôve had a pretty interesting life. Growing up I was quite sheltered by my parents, which I somewhat blame for me being such a wimp. Just because I‚Äôm a guy and I‚Äôm the oldest kid at home I‚Äôve seemed like a strong, athletic, in shape kid but now that I‚Äôm older, I‚Äôm weak, unhealthy, and not in shape. I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm fat, I don't care, if anything I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm becoming fat slowly. So all my life I‚Äôve been seen as this little angel who gets straight As, maybe isn't the most popular but I had great morals and whatnot, my teachers always rave about what a great and nice kid I am. I don't see myself as that at all. I‚Äôve been addicted to porn since I was 12. Most guys my age talk about how awesome porn is and that ‚Äúit‚Äôs the greatest thing invented.‚Äù I think that thats absolutely one of the most fucked up things I‚Äôve ever heard. Watching people dehumanize themselves and expose themselves is so sad to me. When I began watching it I wasn‚Äôt sure what it was. I didn't understand sex. Nobody ever really told me what sex was. My brain was quickly addicted to the virtual cocaine. I‚Äôve never been caught, nobody in my family knows or even thinks I do because I‚Äôm that ‚Äúlittle angel.‚Äù My parents are oblivious, as I‚Äôve been told that they would know and that I couldn't hide it, bullshit. I‚Äôve been watching porn almost everyday for 4 years. after watching it for about a few months I started feeling guilty, I knew that watching people have sex was wrong. The warning at the beginning of the videos that said it was illegal and my natural morals kicked in. Today I don't give a shit about the warning, I feel guilty because I know its wrong. I know that all the times I‚Äôve pretended that I don‚Äôt watch porn i was deliberately lying to my parents. I honestly feel somewhat bad for my parents, they are the greatest people in the world, they haven't done anything wrong, and yet I feel like a fuck up. Why did I start smoking weed and drinking in high school? Why have I tried ecstasy? Why have I devoted hours upon hours of my life to something thats so disgusting and makes me feel so disgusting, guilty and pathetic, and yet I continue to do it. If I was really such a little angel then why have I done all that. I feel like nobody is really there for me. My parents say they are but they clearly don't even know me. I don't have any real friends who I feel comfortable enough to tell them these things. I had one, but she‚Äôs left me alone two times now. Why did I have to fuck that up too? I knew I was in love, and yet I was too much of a wimp to be a man around her. My phone was basically the only way I would talk to her. Technology practically grew my love, and then destroyed it. Twice. She‚Äôs the only person who I really feel like a real person around. I do love her. She‚Äôs the only person who really knows me. I love her. She‚Äôs the only person who has been there for me. I love her. I don't know if she will be anymore and now I feel like I have nobody but my thoughts, which as you can probably tell, aren't very pretty or nice. I miss her. I try to be strong but some times its just too fucking hard to play life off and forget about it. I don't want to kill myself, life is too valuable and I still have dreams. I want to run away and just be alone because thats clearly the only way that my life works. That way I‚Äôd be away from porn, weed (which I actually have been sober from for about a year now), my parents alcohol cabinet, and assholes who I give respect and love too because as I know, we are all people in this planet, so who's to say that someone is better than someone else. WE ARE ALL PEOPLE. WAKEUP CALL TO ASSHOLES. I just simply don't understand why someone could have the capacity to think that they're better than another human. I don‚Äôt hate anyone but myself because I‚Äôm the only one responsible for my life, which I‚Äôm not very happy with. The way I see myself as a person is not someone who is necessarily book smart, but I get life like most people don't. I think about life a lot, what else would I think about? That sport I‚Äôm good at? That party I was invited to? that club I‚Äôm the president of? That thing that society deems as important, because for some reason, we all have to go to school for the ‚Äúbest‚Äù years of our lives and then get a good job, maybe raise a family. and then we eventually die. Another thing about life that I don't understand is why are our expectations so high? Why should teenagers have to do all this work? Why do I feel like society is telling me that every move I make now will determine my future. If I don't get good grades then I wont get into a good college and I wont get a good degree to pursue that career that I want. Or if I do get good grades and do all this hard work but I go to a party and have a good time but maybe I drink and people find out so then I don't get my scholarships and then I wont get accepted by that college that I want to go to to pursue that career that I really want. It seems like you cant make a mistake or two like most people do and live the life you want to. You have to be perfect, which is really hard, especially when you're not popular, or when you weren't able to afford that travel sport team and get better than everyone else and make the high school team, or when people think of you as some sort of angel that only you know you aren't. Life isn‚Äôt fair, I know that, but it also really sucks sometimes, which I think most people don't want to hear even though it‚Äôs true. So yeah that‚Äôs why my life sucks, now let me tell you why I love my life. The one thing that saved me was EDM. The music, the people, the culture that I feel apart of. The only thing that has always been there for me, the thing I proudly call my best friend. The one thing that feels unreal to me because its so amazing and I just cant get enough of electronic music. The first rave I went to I made so many new friends and I felt like I was adopted into something that was so amazing, and I now know that I was adopted into something truly amazing. I live the PLUR life now, and I love it, my life is changed into something I like. I can wake up, put my earphones in, and smile. I don't need drugs to enhance my love. I‚Äôve never gone to a rave while on something. So I truly know that I am apart of something now. I truly feel like I am welcome somewhere. So thank you. Thank you to all the ravers, kandikids, and PLUR preachers. All the dancers, dreamers, jumpers, and fist pumpers. Thank you to all the people who make EDM. To al the innovators of the EDM culture, I hope to one day be among you as EDM is my only true passion and I dream to be a producer and share my music that I hear in my head with the beautiful world some day, some day when I have the money and I don't have the pressure to do other things that are deemed more important by society.

As you can tell from my name, I'm really into his music. Gold Dust was the first EDM song I ever listened to, and he played it as his fucking encore!!!! It wasn't my first show, I saw Zedd at the same venue in September. However, it was the best live music I've ever seen. I rolled for the first time and I felt such a connection with the music, lights, and crowd. I learned what PLUR is. I've never been in such a loving environment. Its safe to say that I'm hooked for good! I can't wait to go to my next in on NYE. Anyway, sorry for all the rambling. I just wanted to introduce myself.

10145,EDM is a lot more organic than most people think...,"Well I listen to a wide variety of music which is basically anything from jazz, to rock, to EDM. I recall going to a Foo Fighters concert and Dave Grohl saying, ""Fuck that electronic shit, and a shout out to those who play real music with real instruments!"" While I do have great respect for him, in the back of my head I knew I was actually pissed off.

I believe that making EDM doesn't take any less brainpower or creative power than Bach's ""Minuet in G"" and that it definitely has a meaning past the beats or synth lines. Each song has a statement its trying to make just like jazz. Yeah, I know its weird comparing the two but I think they're pretty close in terms of the way they want their listeners to react. They both are trying to imply feelings and poetic statements whether it be trumpet or synth lines.

Its not like it's become industrialized like pop has, it is still a writing process very much based on creative power and natural, flowing thoughts. It seems that pop artists now have analysts to show them trends in popular music so that they can tell their money-hungry songwriters to create a product that makes money. EDM is still very much about the music and not about getting stuffed pockets.

You can contact one our members, Core, should you have any questions. Core will also possibly attend his funeral, so if you guys have any stuff, ideas, that we, Lololyrics, can do to show our support, and pay our respects to his family, please post them.

&gt;To answer a big question for most: Yes, lololyrics will most likely be going down. I can't give you concrete answers regarding lolo and its sister-site, Harderstate, yet. But expect this to be very possible.

10174,4 friends going on a roadtrip next spring. EDC or UMF?,"Hi

I don't really know if this is the right subreddit, but anyway, here goes.
We are 4 dudes from Denmark planning a road trip through USA from March till June. On that trip we want see if we can catch at least one festival, and as we are all quite into EDM, we have of course noticed both EDC Vegas and UMF, which both are good options. The thing is though, which one should we choose? We were hoping that perhaps someone with experience could give us some advice. 
We can see that UMF will be slightly more expensive (around 500$) and it will be right at the start of our journey while EDC is a bit cheaper (around 300$) and at the very end of our journey. We are also asking about advice as only two of us will be 21 years old at the time, and as we are Danes we would of course like to be able to drink. Is there any difference in regards to this between the two festivals? Is it even possible at any of them? (Say if the two over 21 just buys for the two other??)

And really, any advice is dearly appreciated even if you have only attended one of the festivals or even none of them!

10175,Hey /r/EDM. I'm a DJ who has been planing on doing monthly-bimonthly hour long live streams of mixes of various genres. Who'd join in?,"**TL;DR;** I want to do hour long monthly-bimonthly live streamed mixes. Would you come listen/listen to it later?

Hey, /r/EDM. So, I've been mixing for about 4 years now of all genres and done/attempted a few mixes for other subreddits like /r/Monstercat and /r/dubstep. 

So, I recently have been teasing the idea of a new project, which is where I do a mix of every genre out there every 2 weeks or month. However, I don't wanna mix for no crowd. That's boring as fuck if I know no one will listen. So I'm just wondering if you guys would tune in for them? I'd do all genres and all sub-genres possible.

The reason I want to do this is because the only other DJ who's paticulaly known for monthly streams is Going Quantam. (Please, correct me if I'm wrong and there are other big names. My research didn't come up with common streamers.) All other known internet DJ's have, dare I say, gone downhill in my opinion? I won't say many names, but they seem to not upload frequently and don't seem to get less known music. A good chunk of the music they mix can be found on Beatport's Top 10 at some point in time.

My plan is, as said before, is to stream/record hour long mixes every month. Then upload these mixes to my [Soundcloud.](https://soundcloud.com/michaelhill-2) For finding music, I do have a few ideas. I do get a lot of music from here and other music subs. Or put up a suggestion list every month somewhere, on reddit, my channel, where people can post a song that falls under that category. 

I'm open for suggestions, opinions, any ""I'd totally tune in every mix for some new music, fuck yeah."" or ""Nah, you'd be wasting your time. Stick to regular DJ-ing.""

EDIT: Before I get banned, I didn't think that I should've posted this to /r/edmproduction since I'm not a producer and I'll get shat on left and right for being a DJ going to producers for advice.",EDM,1381453197,Mikeyoyo,0,2,True,2013-10-10

I went to Burning Man. Drugs were everywhere. EDM was everywhere. I've also been to EDC. EDC was twice as big, in terms of population (at least this year; it was four times as big as the year I went, and someone was killed ‚Äì not OD'd, killed! ‚Äì¬†the year I went!), and had fewer sexual assaults and arrests per capita. If we were to compare to TomorrowWorld, the numbers are even ""better"" in favor of EDM.

There are deaths fairly regularly at BM and there are no calls for Burning Man or the regional/local burns to be ended (I am aware of the BLM complaints, but they are hardly on the scale of, say, the RAVE act). What is going on here? Is it just marketing?",EDM,1380804813,abiggerbetty,9,5,True,2013-10-03
10187,"Going to my first EDM show in a of couple weeks, what is the dress code usually like for the smaller shows as opposed to festivals?","I'm seeing Pretty LIghts + Krewella in a couple of weeks and I'm unsure of how the dress code for these shows compare to what someone would wear at a festival. At Electric Zoo it seemed to be kandi, necklaces, and the more flamboyant the clothes the better (even saw a couple with clothes painted on).",EDM,1380814448,assoyster,11,0,True,2013-10-03

Second, I noticed that the discussion on Krewella's new 'Get Wet' album has received quite a few more comments than is usually seen. Every Tuesday (or whenever a major album is dropped), there should be a thread dedicated solely to discussion on each new album.

Known on Twitter as ‚ÄòDJ Boyfriend‚Äô and ‚ÄòDJ Girlfriend‚Äô, Chris and Ashley have been lovers of music ever since they met at the State College of New York‚Äôs Albany campus. Ever since their first date at Webster Hall, the pair felt a strong connection to dance music, and felt a strong connection to their fellow patrons who they affectionately refer to as their ‚Äòfamily‚Äô.

It wasn‚Äôt till the day of the show that they messaged me ‚ÄúAll set!!! A Thing Called Love around 8:30 look out for the screen! Let us know how it goes!!! Even though we know she‚Äôll say yes!!‚Äù . I was so happy ‚Äì I kept pulling people aside and telling them when it would happen. Finally when the show came we met up with a mob of our friends. Ashley just thought it was because we all loved Above and Beyond. I led everyone into the crowd ‚Äî I was able to get to the exact spot she first seen Above and Beyond in.""

I don't see what experience or journey you can have when you straight up wild out and act like an animal. You are ruining the experience for everyone when you are raging out and doing the mosh pit.

Raves are not about that, its about peace and love. But you have music like Knife Party (I love me some Knife Party) and I shit you not, people Moshin at Adventure Club (NYC EZOO AFTER PARTY, some 2nd stage right side).

10249,"Kraak &amp; Smaak interview: Good for the City, disappointment with Daft Punk and future plans with Sam Duckworth","**Greetings guys, cheers for taking the time to chat with Bass Explorer! Your newest creation, ‚ÄòGood For The City‚Äô drops September 9th on Jalapeno Records, featuring the vocal talent of Sam Duckworth. Tell us about the track and the how collaboration process panned out.**

Originally our label Jalapeno Records came up with the idea and hooked us up, already quite some time ago. We had this cool, indie-kinda quirky instrumental groove shelved and sent it to him to see if he could work it, which turned out great: we dig his voice and he a great lyrical talent you don‚Äôt come across very often; we think we‚Äôre a great match and this has turned to be a perfect single‚Ä¶ and by the way, we have been toying around more with each other on other tracks since then as well, so more Sam &amp; Kraak &amp; Smaak is definitely coming. Will keep you posted!

**The sound of the release could be compared to that of Daft Punk‚Äôs ‚ÄòGet Lucky‚Äô. Did that play an influence on how you tackled this release?**

Definitely, but it was more the Chic influence in DP‚Äôs ‚ÄòGet Lucky‚Äô really and not Daft Punk themselves. We actually tried it out just for fun: we took the version we had up until then and replayed the bassline, added strings, and then there was this cool disco version all of a sudden.. We just had to do something with that. Over time other versions have passed by, more outspoken electronic mostly, but this seemed the best fit out of all of them.

**I, for one, found Daft Punk‚Äôs ‚ÄòRandom Access Memories‚Äô utterly uninspiring. For you, was the LP a hit or a miss? Do you think it‚Äôs had any influence on the music of today?**

Well, same here really‚Ä¶ We loved Get Lucky, which is a great pop single in it‚Äôs own right. The album however‚Ä¶ djeez. It felt all a bit bloated overall. They are still a huge name and have thrown great live shows as well, great promotional strategy  but there is far more exciting and fresh stuff to be found of course. In that sense their real trendsetting days are absolutely over.

10260,Hi Reddit. My name is George McClure and here's a piece of me.,"So here's a little bit of background on me: I'm 19 years old and currently attending university at Texas State. My dad passed away when I was four, and I was adopted when I was 13 years old. 

Life has gotten much better since then. I got ahold of music when I was 12, which got me through alot of tough times in my life, and got hooked on to the electronic scene in 2008. This is my first gathering of original music. Which is representative of my first year of college. Which involved a LOT of things. My adopted fathers' unemployment, my biological mother's relapse, as well as my own personal growth as a person, with women, myself, alcohol, depression, etc. This EP means alot to me and even if it sucks and no one likes it, I'd like to at least put it out there. It's a piece of me. The mastering is subpar, the production value as a whole is probably subpar. But this means a lot to me. And maybe....just maybe. A handful of you will like it. Have a good one. ~George

10269,Working on a idea for producing music - challenge yourself to think outside of the box.,"Hello, 
I have this concept that i am working on. 

I have created a so-called randomizer, what gives you rules what you need to do when you open a new empty project.  (Please note this is very basic at the moment - just an idea draft.) It says what kind of oscillators you have to use, what time signature and etc. 

The point is to challenge yourself when you are out of ideas, your mind is blank and you have hit a ""musical blockade"" - Conflict will give you a set of rules that you need to follow. When i was studying at Denmark i actually found that method really useful, as it forces you think outside of the box and the results may be really rewarding. 

So.. i have layed out the idea, now i/we should start adding more. 
What should be added? Should it be categorized (eg: EFFECTS: use x, use y etc.) Maybe do some templates for ""House"" ""Drum'and'bass"" ""Techno"" etc. 

There are a lot of possibilities! : ) 
I'm eagerly waiting for your ideas, if you think this could go somewhere as a great/fun tool for musicians.

If every electronic music subreddit did this, it would make getting into a narrowly defined genre much much easier. Instead of scrambling to put together links every time someone asks you for recommendations for a certain genre/style, you can simply link to a subreddit's wiki. I've included ours below for reference if anyone wants to use the source code from it to design their own.

2. Dada Life vs Guetta 
Would prefer Dada here, but its a bit inconvenient. I would either have to leave hardwell early, or go to Dada Late. If i stayed through Dada, id be getting to the tiesto stage 45 minutes before and would probably not get a decent spot.

Recently I've heard a few modern throwbacks to that old school sound (at least in my opinion). For example, [Toronto Is Broken - Spirit Song 2012](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vShWcK-l7o), and the intro of [Pendulum - Set Me On Fire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeOJDgAu4LE).

I found a few breaks mixes and while great, I'm looking for tracks that are specifically similar to the examples I mentioned (heavy use of an amen break, less of a 4x4 house vibe, and some classic old school samples never hurt haha).

I hope I've been descriptive enough, and that requesting tunes/artists isn't frowned upon in this sub. Thanks in advance!

10302,Let's Debate - My Top 5 Electronic Artists Under 25,"Nicolas Jaar -

Typically when you meet a person who has graduated from Brown with a degree in comparative literature, one would expect for an accompanying occupation in the realm of literature. Well, Nicolas Jaar has seamlessly defied that stereotype and in a much louder way. Originally born in New York, shortly followed by a life changing move to Chile, Jaar‚Äôs childhood was infused with an environment of creative decadence. Son of Chilean artist Alfredo Jaar, Nicolas learned the nature of his creative abilities at a very young age. Returning to New York as a teenager, Jaar‚Äôs sound molding influences included not only emotionally driven house producers but also styles hereditary to South American countries and the Middle East. Committed to breaking the the typical ‚ÄòBPM‚Äô barriers generic to the underground genres, Jaar‚Äôs journey-esque productions rarely breaking the 100 beats per minute threshold. Receiving numerous awards for his devotion to uniqueness and performances in which he always plays live, Jaar became one of the most revered artists worldwide following his selection as Resident Advisor‚Äôs #1 electronic live act. Topping considered legends such as Guy Gerber, Guti, Martin Buttrich &amp; Disclosure to name a few, the young Brown graduate‚Äôs less than a decade of music experience bettered well over 100 years of combined music experience presented by his fellow 19 acknowledged live artists. Although these lists may sometimes mean nothing more than a nice ‚Äòcareer cap‚Äô feather for the high ranked artists, for an artist like Nicolas Jaar it means significantly more. It doesn‚Äôt make him better or the best so to speak in comparison to the legends listed below him, but as a 23 year old who completely went against the grain and created something so new and so original, it‚Äôs a clear cut validation of success and the listeners not only getting the concept but also appreciating it. Nicolas Jaar‚Äôs story is along the lines of those you may hear occasionally where the banker quits to become a painter or a lawyer quits to volunteer at a prison. Not only is it about the giving up of a life fully by his Ivy League degree and the rarity of this kind of situation, but more importantly he made the type of a decision a fully grown and intelligent man would struggle with for years ‚Äì he did it at 19.

AN21 - 
Within the realm of Size Records‚Äô kingdom, a legion of electronic troubadours find refuge. As Steve Angello sits upon the throne as king, to his right stands his brother and partner in crime ‚Äì AN21. Exposed to the DJ life since a very young age, AN21‚Äôs journey to international superstar began much earlier than the success of his brother. Rather than jumping aboard the bandwagon following the flood of mass appeal Steve and his production partner Axwell garnered with the Swedish House Mafia project, AN21 spent countless hours watching the two hard at work day after day in his childhood home. Although it was a delayed decision in terms of devoting his life to music and DJing, AN21 was only 18 when the limelight shined brightly upon him. Similar to Steve, the young Swede also had a devout passion for the underground style sounds which can be subtly noticed today in his productions. Eventually becoming a key player in the building of the now considered iconic label and affiliated brands, Size Records &amp; Size Events, AN21 has successfully etched his own place in dance music culture outside his big brother‚Äôs shadow. Currently working hand in hand with fellow Size youngblood Max Vangeli, the two tour the world together offering attendees a chance to indulge in electrifying back to back sets. Still the considered ‚Äòbaby‚Äô of the Size Records family, AN21 is musically developed well beyond his years and his track record clearly shows it. Making sure to distinguish his own unique style and sound, AN21 is musically matured well beyond his years.

Dzeko &amp; Torres - 
This youthful pair of Canucks have made the supposedly lengthy music ladder appear to be nothing more than a short hop. Julian Dzeko (21) and Luis Torres (24) aka Dzeko &amp; Torres are one of EDM‚Äôs hottest commodities in 2013. Already boasting a discography that includes two chart topping singles along with releases on Dim Mak, Ultra Records and Atlantic Records, these college aged producers have skyrocketed from talented up and comers to A-listers in a matter of short months. Publicly endorsed by the likes of Tiesto, Steve Aoki and Deniz Koyu, it‚Äôs very clear that unlike many one hit youngbloods of years past, these Canadians are the real deal. Recently headlining the main stages of international super festivals such as Tomorrowland, Coachella and BPM, the touring train has shown no signs of stopping as they prepare to headline Electric Zoo‚Äôs mainstage in celebration of it‚Äôs fifth anniversary. Hailing from a long line of talented Toronto bred DJs and producers, Dzeko and Torres represent a strong testament of Canada‚Äôs music culture.

AraabMuzik -
Born and raised in the small New England vacationers paradise of Rhode Island, Abraham Orellana aka AraabMuzik is one of today‚Äôs most interesting artists. Many may argue that he isn‚Äôt a real DJ, and we agree. Orellana hails from a deeply rooted hip hop background. Learning about the MPC drum pad as a teenager on the internet, Abraham quickly mastered on the fly beatmaking and sample manipulation. Leading to a successful number of collaborations with respected hip hop artists such as Cam‚ÄôRon, Jim Jones, Juelz Santana, Fabolous amongst countless others, AraabMuzik‚Äôs unique ‚Äòmade in real time‚Äô production style quickly forged him a reputation for not only being a talented music maker but also a creative mastermind. Eventually transitioning to the world of ‚ÄòEDM‚Äô in the past couple of years, the new AraabMuzik sound is a melting pot of hip hop, dubstep and electro. Representing a pioneer of sorts when it comes to cross genre meshing, AraabMuzik has epitomized the meaning of ‚Äòage being only a number‚Äô.

Maya Jane Coles - 

Hailing from the musically enriched community found within the UK, multi-faceted production extraordinaire Maya Jane Coles has successfully taken the music industry by storm in a very short time. Following her career forging breakout in 2010, Coles has consistently picked up steam and it doesn‚Äôt appear that a ceiling exists in that regard. With recent career milestones surpassed such as a compilation for the infamous DJ-Kicks series, magazine features in MixMag &amp; Rolling Stone and a slew of coveted awards that include DJ Mag‚Äôs ‚ÄòProducer Of The Year‚Äô. Keeping all of this in mind, Maya is only 25 and her journey to success has been in motion since her mid teens. Following the release of her latest album in early 2013, ‚ÄòMJC‚Äô revealed that not only did she produce the tracks featured but also handled all the engineering &amp; vocal works. Also known for successful stints in producing dubstep and hip hop under an array of various aliases, Maya Jane Coles is clearly one of those phenomenons not easily found in contemporary music culture. Oh, did we mention that she was dubbed one of the ‚Äò25 DJs That Rule The World‚Äô by Rolling Stone? So much for the saying ‚Äòyouth is wasted on the young‚Äô. Miss Coles has succeeded well beyond the average expectations of a 25 year old.

10307,Does dancing still exist within EDM?!,"Has anyone else noticed, as electronic dance music has exploded stateside, there is actually far less dancing? Sure, fingers can be pointed to the rise of bass music (dubstep, trap, hyperbass, brostep.....); however, is it the music that has caused this or the new generation of ""raver"" and their expectations of live events? First, how many of us have been to parties/festivals recently where it is just impossible to dance due to space restrictions? For instance, when everyone is standing around taking pictures and videos or holding their spirit stick, there is simply no room to move. Hell, 10 years ago, Drum and Bass/hardcore techno/hardstyle undergrounds would be full to the brim (sweat literally rolling from the ceiling) but with the entire room moving the dancefloor just seemed to open up and invite dancing. Then again, expectations were much different before the EDM boom. People showed up to dance, make new friends, escape from the mundane. Now, people show up to hear the biggest tracks, rage the hardest, and ""be seen"" within the hype of EDM festival culture. With people expecting the biggest tracks, opposed to a well mixed exploratory set, the DJs either deliver or risk loosing bookings next touring season. So, sets de-evolve to repetitive crescendos and expected drops. Just my two cents, but was sparked by this article: http://thefrontliner.com/editorial-2/electronic-jump-music-the-state-of-dance-among-todays-edm-fans-26343.

Would love to read others thoughts. And if certain regions can actually still go to dance parties. I fear, living in Chicago, I may have been exposed to an overabundance of scene kids and hipsters for a real perspective on the matter. ",EDM,1376669143,dstaples999,0,1,True,2013-08-16

10322,serious question for the ladies of /EDM,"so, uh, when's an appropriate time to dance with a lady?

I've been listening to EDM and going to shows for three years now, and as a dude raised with respect for ladies, this is the most confusing thing in the scene, to me.

we've all been there - you're pushed up in the crowd, trying to get weird to  the DJ's sick tunes, and a girly pushes her way up in front of you and starts dancing. she'll brush back against you while she sways to the music...

so, ladies, when is it appropriate for my hands to hit your hips and start the ridiculous process of grinding? I ask mainly because I just can't jab my cock into a strangers' back, yet I see girls who were dancing in front of me grinding up on dudes next to me.

so, should I try to ask to dance? am I missing a signal? or am I just supposed to jab my crotch into strangers' backs? I'm really quite kindhearted and it seems wrong, but, yanno, I'm down to dance some at shows.

I don't know, I guess I just feel like I should be asking these things, since I've never gotten a straight answer from girlies in the RL.

**edit**: okay, just to clarify a few things.

first, grinding is the wrong word. I'm just not a dancer, really, and that's what I've always been told, uh, 'dancing while standing in the spoon position' was called. I'll leave it intact, but mention that it's incorrect.

second, for those of you who mentioned the outright creepiness factor of my request, HOW THE FUCK DO *YOU* DEAL WITH A SEA OF PEOPLE MAKING CONSTANT PHYSICAL CONTACT WITH YOU? I did post this in motherfucking /r/EDM, right? there are literally people touching you at all times, and when you add in the occasional crowd-surfer, mosh-pit, drunk dude stumbling through people spilling his drink on you and entire sections of crowd almost falling down after losing their balance thanks to said drunk dude, it gets hectic. how the hell am I creepy for wondering if the girl in front of me wants to dance after shoving back into me several times? I don't *do* anything, I keep my distance and my hands up. that's how I rage it out. I just can't figure out a way to communicate in the deafening sweat pits that are EDM shows, hence, my post.

third, what fucking EDM shows are you going to where you can even have a conversation in the building with someone? I'm not talking about raves, I'm talking about shitty dubstep/trap/moonbah/whatever shows. the last show I went to, I could seriously feel the bass making the liquor in my stomach shake while outside smoking a cigarette. get that?

10370,Great response to DA's article on how Producers/Djs dont need to sell out,"Something that people need to understand, is there is a remarkably small amount of money in dance music for how much work goes into it. There will always be Afrojack or Deadmau5 making millions of dollars, but for every one of those guys, there‚Äôs hundreds of Felix Cartal/Clockwork/Nick Thayer/etc.-level producers who make relatively a lot less money, but are expected/required to be on tour EVERY FUCKIN DAY of the year. Imagine never coming home, never having a minute of rest, being on airplanes constantly and in and out of hotels and taxis on 3-5 hours of sleep. I‚Äôm sure that sounds like an enchanted fantasy for most of you, but the reality is it gets old fast, and you often get floored by a cold or the flu because your under-nourished and under-slept body starts giving out on you. It takes a lot of work to put together a great DJ set (many, many hours if you‚Äôre doing something besides the Steve Aoki play-songs-front-to-back and hit people with cakes) ‚Ä¶ You can‚Äôt expect producer/DJs/performers/whatever to come up with new, spanking original DJ sets constantly for shows and simultaneously expect them to put out piles of quality music at a breakneck pace for FREE dollars, that you will also expect to never pay a cent for.

Here‚Äôs an example:
After playing a show and schmoozing with people until 3am in Vancouver, you have to get on a flight to Miami that boards at 7:20. You‚Äôre at the airport/going to the airport for 2+ hours starting at 5am, the whole time in the car/waiting at the airport you are curating (responding to tweets, tweeting) your Twitter account so that hyper active fans can get a piece of you every second of the day, answering emails from your probably-partially-incompetent management team and lazy-booking agents about interviews, the show you have that night in Miami, etc. Then you‚Äôre on a plane for many hours. During this time, you are not sleeping, you are probably having to spend this time working on a new remix, since every modern music consumer will forget about you unless you put out a new, spot-on, hyped out track at least once per month (the exception to this is people like Tiesto, Steve Aoki, etc., who to varying degrees have haven‚Äôt written an original note of their own music in years [if ever], but have farm production studios writing their jams for them to keep up with the times ‚Äì they don‚Äôt have to worry about creating anything on airplanes [or anywhere else]). You get to Miami, and maybe you have a second for dinner or to eat somewhere, but of course you didn‚Äôt get lunch except for airplane food (which always sucks) and if you got breakfast it was probably just coffee to keep your brain going. You‚Äôre not going to show up to the club and find a spread of sandwiches on your rider because that is truly only for a very small minority of live performers, of which you are probably not a member. After playing another high-energy set (that may or may not have had some sort of stressful technical problem, the sound guy was an ass, your computer is crashing in one way or another, the bootleg you printed didn‚Äôt print right so you have to last-minute adjust something in the setlist to replace it) and hyping up the crowd as much as possible, you‚Äôll probably be drunk and/or drinking more to keep up with the promoters and the 10-15 people backstage who think you‚Äôre a hero and want to give you free alcohol (again, while you may think this sounds great, after the 50th time it doesn‚Äôt hold the same allure when you‚Äôve done the same thing for the last 3 weeks and would rather have a nice meal and a second to rest your ears than dealing with DJ LocalguyhippoXX trying to become friends with you and shoving Smirnoff down your throat), so your body will again be slammed when you wake up in the morning, after 3 more hours of sleep, and get on another airplane to Austin, TX to do the same thing all over again.

I love music and always will, but I‚Äôm sick of hearing anybody say anything about music that doesn‚Äôt pay respect to the fact that all of us in this industry are working very hard (even Skrillex and Avicii, who have buckets of money now, are two of the hardest working guys in this industry [and on the topic, continue to write their own music despite pressures in the industry to do otherwise]) to create an excellent music experience for you all while trying to stay relatively healthy and make enough money to have an apartment and eat decent food ‚Äì which is very, very difficult when the amount of money we make from the sale of the actual music we work so hard to create is basically $0 so we have to live in airports and vans and taxis and (if you‚Äôre lucky/rich) tour buses on tour to pay the bills.

Either start paying for music so that musicians in general can live a normal life, or don‚Äôt bitch about what the musicians today are doing.",EDM,1374257688,blahblah2424,1,1,True,2013-07-19
10371,2nd Listen ATGH - Was Deadmau5 ahead of the curve?,"I am listening to Album Title Goes Here after the recent Afrojack - Deadmau5 battle on soundcloud. I find myself much more enjoying the music now, than at the initial release back almost a year ago. 

September last year, Deadmau5 dropped something that didn't sound like the mainstream wave at the time, which has continued into the current trends. 2013 rolled around with a summer season of the same and a barrage of artists calling out the stale nature of the EDM scene at the moment and hailing the salvation album from Daft Punk, which turned out not to be an EDM album at all...

Now I go back and listen to this album from Deadmau5 and it feels like its more fresh now than it was in Sept 2012. I have to say that despite his loathful behavior and shame-tastic comments, perhaps Zimmerman really does have a creative spark ahead of the curve compared to other artists. To each their own preference, but this album sounds much better now than it did a year ago... how does that happen?

10405,Kill The Noise - Roots/My World (Brillz Remix) Confusion (x-post from /r/trap),"So I've noticed recently that A LOT of places have the same song by Kill The Noise, remixed by Brillz but with different names. About half show the correct name as Roots (Brillz Remix) and most show it incorrectly as My World (Brillz Remix).

Figured I would point this out for anyone else who may/may not have noticed this. Listen to the originals and then to the remix and it is clear that Roots has been remixed by Brillz, not My World.

10413,Making\Selling custom mixes in a last ditch attempt to fund my way to EDC. (I'm an actual producer/DJ),"Hey everyone! Lately I happened to hit a bad patch of life financially, and now I'm facing the possibility of missing out on my favorite festival, which also has the best lineup of the year. So now I'm doing whatever I can to fund my way to EDC Las Vegas. To help with that, I decided to go ahead and make custom mixes for anyone that wishes to donate to my cause and help me get to Vegas! 


Here's the details and options...



Options:


Digital Mix - This can be either a continuous mix, or I can break the mix up into tracks for you so you can burn it to CD if you would like. This will be sent directly to your email or I will host it on a dropbox or on mediafire/zippyshare/any site you want. 

CD - I will send you the mix burned onto a CD with the same options as the Digital Mix so you can either play it through or skip to your favorite parts. The only thing I would require is a few extra dollars to pay for shipping.

The mixes will be an hour long (give or take longer) which can be anywhere from 15 - 25 songs depending on how quickly you like the transitions to be. You can chose your favorite songs from any genre of Electronic Music and either let me know if you want the Original Mix or if you want me to throw in my favorite Remix of the song. I also have a large library of unique and awesome mashups so there is always the option for that as well. I'm charging only $5 for the mixes/CDs, but if you would like to donate more I will make sure to give you as much extra stuff as possible and, make future mixes for you, and of course love you forever. 

If you would like to check out my stuff ahead of time, you can find me on [Soundcloud](http://www.soundcloud.com/JohnnyHammerstix) and on [Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com/JohnnyHammerstix). 

Whatever the case, I hope you guys all have an awesome day and enjoy EDC if you're going! :)

I just need somewhere to rant about this. It's a bit hard to believe this attitude still exists. 

1. No, Daft Punk did not ""save"" EDM. Dance music is doing just fine on its own right now, thank you very much. Although admittedly there do seem to be a growing number of profiteering scoundrels getting in on the newfound popularity for a quick buck, the style, the method of creation, the music itself, doesn't need fixing. It's continually improving and evolving, sure, but not in the direction he suggests it is.

2. In fact, it would be very difficult to call Random Access Memories EDM. It's mostly jazz, soft rock, etc., as created by a group whose work has mainly been dance music. There's nothing remotely dance-y on the album.

3. No, electronic music has not been soulless up until now. 

I don't know. I just wish people would grow up and learn that their musical tastes aren't true or false, especially jounalists. This sort of closed-minded idiocy never fails to deliver.

10438,In need of help producing a rebuttal to this statement degrading EDM.,"This kid I went to high school with (who by no means is a bright student whatsoever) constantly talks shit about EDM on every social networking platform he has. He is the type of kid that knows the chemical make up of MDMA and tries to correlate it to EDM as much as possible and says that everything about EDM in general has a negative effect on society and the lives of teenagers (like myself). I believe everyone is entitled to their own opinion because music is very subjective, but the things he says about EDM make me believe he reads very biased news articles on the EDM scene more than he has actually taken part in it. I'm very fond of most electronic music (both when sober and intoxicated), love going to concerts and festivals, and have never once touched MDMA or Molly, and would like to start asking him why he is so against the whole scene even though I anticipate him wanting to be a stubborn asshole more than back his bold statements up with logical explanation. To add another level of complexity to this, he is a VERY big advocate for marijuana legalization. He smokes nearly everyday, posts pictures on Instagram of his bud, and acts very biased when making statements about his beliefs. Now, I smoke pot too, but have never felt the need to publicize it or use it to gain attention, and I agree with him on some of his views, but like all drugs there ARE pros and cons to using them, legalizing them, etc. Just wanted to add that I am not a hardcore anti-drug advocate, but I am not using the internet to try and change peoples opinions and actions just because I don't like them. 

One of the biggest things I disagree with is this quote he posted: 


‚ÄúArtists are overcompensating with this aggressive, energetic, hyperstimulating music ‚Äì it‚Äôs like someone shaking you,‚Äù Bangalter continued. ‚ÄúBut it can‚Äôt move people on an emotional level. It‚Äôs a way to feel alive, but...‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not deep, it‚Äôs surface,‚Äù de Homem-Christo added.

I strongly disagree with this and believe that EDM moves people on an emotional level ALL the time. At live shows especially, when the DJ takes the crowd on a 2 hour musical journey. I listen to music that is very hyper stimulating, from progressive house to trance, I am open to all genres and like certain songs because of the emotion they make me feel. Anyways, I'd like to hear some input from others who have more experience in the EDM scene and also disagree with how EDM is just a pile of shit that everyone uses an excuse to roll on Molly.

Remixes of songs are another thing to keep up on, as well as other content that didn't previously exist such as live feeds of shows. 

So, is having millions of sources for EDM really beneficial if one wants to keep current? Would it be too ""mainstream"" to have a single hub of all EDM content?

10461,EDM concert etiquette,"Okay. I'll admit up front: this is a really silly question (and a bit embarrassing, so I'm posting from a throwaway).

I've been listening to EDM for years (longer than this sub has been around, I think), but just made it to my first concert last week. Prior to this, most of my concert-going experience has involved venues with assigned seating (i.e. the complete opposite of what I experienced). Based on videos of live performances, I has sort of assumed the atmosphere would be club-like, but that's still not quite right; people are there for the artist, not for... whatever it is people go to clubs for (and as a result are all facing the stage, more interested in the music than in conversation, etc.).

I assumed the rules of etiquette would be somewhat intuitive (in a traditional venue, it takes all of 30 seconds to learn, for example, that you don't get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of a piece and you wait by the door to return to your seat until there's another break), but that didn't seem to be the case and there seemed to be all sorts of exceptions.

As a simple observation, it seems like pushing your way to the front of the dance floor is generally considered rude unless you're trying to get to a group of your friends, in which case it's probably okay. That seemed intuitive enough. Knowing how to react when a girl starts grinding up against you seems like an art form.

Given that I can't seem to figure this stuff out on my own and am going to another concert this weekend... what should I know?

10462,EDM Sets Subreddit,"Hey /EDM,

I've been aware of the subreddit /r/mixes for sometime, but have found it to be more for personal/fresh producers to post mixes rather than for large, well known artists. I've seen many posts of recent sets from EDCNY or Coachella or Jambalaya Festival and yet they really had no proper place for such threads. So, I went ahead and created /r/EDMsets for Redditors to post recent sets, or even general long mixes. 

One of my main desires for this is to be able to post such sets and then in the comments list the full track listings of the sets. If no track list can be found or obtained, then users could collaborate and figure out what tracks exist within the set and in what order.

Please pay a visit and check out what's posted as well as post some sets/mixes yourself. I'd also like to know if any other subreddits like this exist. Let me know, and thanks.",EDM,1369236373,Ukazi2021,6,7,True,2013-05-22

10467,Bowl Tanking to tunes. [x-post from r/trees],"So I have a grinder of bud for about four decent bong packs, and just a few minutes ago I picked a five minute tune to my headphones and tanked a bowl through it.

 I had the idea afterwards to ask you all for songs to tank to.

I would prefer to have the songs be over 4 minutes in length. I can finish a bowl in less time, and if you want to issue a challenge song, or video/media thing, then I can set aside a pack for that too. I'm only doing that once, however, because I find if I do it repeatedly I am very uncomfortable.

[Pendulum - Masochist VIP](http://youtu.be/nThq_sNZkQA)

10471,Just my 2 cents on the EDM scene.,"WHEEW!! it's FESTIE SEASON again!!! but wait, what are you actually excited about? I remember getting into this whole ""EDM"" craze about 3 years ago, (and yes, I realize I am still fairly new to the whole scene)  but what I have seen happen in those three years to the culture, and just about everything surrounding electronic dance music as a whole has been devastating to the point where I feel compelled enough to write this. 

I can confidently say that I began to listen to electronic music a little before the ""wave"" came into the states of it going mainstream seeing as I was one of the few people in my group of friends that listened to it, and I used to get made fun of for putting it on at parties. Little did I know what would happen with the future of the music i grew to love. 

That's where I began to notice the first problem.

Every time I would go out, I be forced to listen to one of your mainstream Top 40 DJ's and also have to listen to a group of proclaimed followers blathering about how they love ""Dj Avicii"" or ""Dj Swedish House Mafia."" When really those were the only 2 edm artists that they knew. I hate their music, but I was going to keep my mouth shut because I guessed it was cool that some people were starting to notice EDM in SOME way. (even if it was commercialized mainstream pop crap.) 

That's where the madness began. 

	Another year goes by, and I had already been through my wave of shows, concerts, and summer music festivals so I got the whole idea of what the culture was like (from being in Chicago). I had slaved myself in my friends room producing music day in and day out because I love electronic music, making music, and the changing shifts of new genres emerging every couple months. In that amount of time is when everyone else around me also caught on to the craze. I'm saying this in a bad way either like ""oh I liked it before anyone else did"" or ""you're all a bunch of band wagoners for liking it"" because lets face it, it is really good music. Even my mom and sister like some of it, and they only listen to whatever's on the local country radio stations. It has just come to a point where I feel that the whole ""Electronic Dance Music"" scene isn't really about the ""music"" anymore in the eyes of (most of) our generation.

	I see people that I know spending 100+ dollars to go to a show at the Congress Theatre in Chicago on artists that I honestly would never spend over 25 dollars to see even if i had liked them. For what? there's gonna be the EXACT same show the next month at the exact same venue. All the people in our generation have this idea planted in their minds where they cannot miss out on anything that their friends are doing or that anyone else around them is doing because they can't stand to be the one on the outside looking in. Sure, it's a bad feeling but these ""concerts"" are not something that come around once in a blue moon either. They really just want to go so they can get fucked up on drugs with their posse and ""rage"" out. Yes, I also understand that Extacy and all these drugs were apart of the whole ""Rave Scene"" in the 90's but that was when it was a very small group of people in a counter culture. Now even my 14 year old neighbor knows what ""molly"" is. It has gotten so ridiculous to the point where one cannot be associated without the other. Every event I go to (which is hardly ever anymore) I am amazed by the amounts of shirts and hats with drug references and the amount of people I hear only talking about drug use and what drugs they're on. I personally was never one for any of that, and hell if that's what you wanna do, then do it. don't boast about it and have it be the reason that you're going to these events. Sure, I like getting drunk from time to time at shows, but that's never on my list of priorities when I go to an event. I have a love for the music and the innovation and it's potential to change the course of music for years to come. Our generation has just been force fed the idea of Sex, Drugs and Alcohol way too hard to the point where you can hear it on the radio and see it on television. The worst part is that these people don't even know what they are taking half the time and don't realize what they are doing to their bodies. 

	The more I dug into the music scene and the more big-name producers I have talked to, I began to see how much of the whole wave of EDM in the states was all just a big cash crop and was being completely stripped of it's culture from the inside out. I could list at least 10 ""producers"" that don't even actually make their own music and have people doing it for them. Even more sad than that, I can name a handful of ""Dj's"" that don't even actually mix or beat-match when they're on stage; they just play pre mixed CDs and stand on the stage. So what are you paying for to be there? -Because it's definitely not a performance. The whole commercialization of EDM has turned every ""DJ"" into a corporate brand name so to speak. Everyone only pays attention to those big names and never bothers to dig outside of the mainstream. Everyone of these mainstream acts all cycle through the same songs which all are composed the same way, ultimately making something that has nothing to do with performing the actual music itself deemed ""good"" in the EDM scene. I would hear groups, I literally mean GROUPS of different people talking about how Steve Aoki was a great ""DJ"" because of everything he did besides ACTUALLY ""DJ"" These people go on talking about how they wanted to go to his show so they can see him ride an inflatable raft in a crowd and get a cake thrown in their face‚Ä¶ Think about it. ANYONE can do that. Shit, my 7 year old cousin can do what he is doing. He is literally STANDING ON A STAGE, PRESSING PLAY ON A CD PLAYER, and he sells out every show. That is when i noticed that people were no long going for the music they were going because he is a familiar name so everyone assumes they will be in for a good time. 

	I can clearly tell that if scene keeps going in the direction that it is now, EDM will go in a downward spiral really, really fast. The lack of innovation from the producers standpoint and the lack of knowledge and lust for drugs from the listener/ crowd's standpoint is making a horrible rep for the scene. It's quite sad, but a lot of these problems I've come to notice have sadly been due to the fact that ""everyone else is doing it"" and thy feel that's how they have to fit in when they go to these events. Numerous different artists/ DJ's have already spoken out about the issue and even some have announced that they are going to be done performing due to where the scene is headed. So please, can we breathe some life back into the scene?

I personally was never one for any of that, and hell if that's what you wanna do, then do it. don't boast about it and have it be the reason that you're going to these events. Sure, I like getting drunk from time to time at shows, but that's never on my list of priorities when I go to an event. I have a love for the music and the innovation and it's potential to change the course of music for years to come. Our generation has just been force fed the idea of Sex, Drugs and Alcohol way too hard to the point where you can hear it on the radio and see it on television. The worst part is that these people don't even know what they are taking half the time and don't realize what they are doing to their bodies. 

	The more I dug into the music scene and the more big-name producers I have talked to, I began to see how much of the whole wave of EDM in the states was all just a big cash crop and was being completely stripped of it's culture from the inside out. I could list at least 10 ""producers"" that don't even actually make their own music and have people doing it for them. Even more sad than that, I can name a handful of ""Dj's"" that don't even actually mix or beat-match when they're on stage; they just play pre mixed CDs and stand on the stage. So what are you paying for to be there? -Because it's definitely not a performance. The whole commercialization of EDM has turned every ""DJ"" into a corporate brand name so to speak. Everyone only pays attention to those big names and never bothers to dig outside of the mainstream. Everyone of these mainstream acts all cycle through the same songs which all are composed the same way, ultimately making something that has nothing to do with performing the actual music itself deemed ""good"" in the EDM scene. I would hear groups, I literally mean GROUPS of different people talking about how Steve Aoki was a great ""DJ"" because of everything he did besides ACTUALLY ""DJ"" These people go on talking about how they wanted to go to his show so they can see him ride an inflatable raft in a crowd and get a cake thrown in their face‚Ä¶ Think about it. ANYONE can do that. Shit, my 7 year old cousin can do what he is doing. He is literally STANDING ON A STAGE, PRESSING PLAY ON A CD PLAYER, and he sells out every show. That is when i noticed that people were no long going for the music they were going because he is a familiar name so everyone assumes they will be in for a good time. 

	I can clearly tell that if scene keeps going in the direction that it is now, EDM will go in a downward spiral really, really fast. The lack of innovation from the producers standpoint and the lack of knowledge and lust for drugs from the listener/ crowd's standpoint is making a horrible rep for the scene. It's quite sad, but a lot of these problems I've come to notice have sadly been due to the fact that ""everyone else is doing it"" and thy feel that's how they have to fit in when they go to these events. Numerous different artists/ DJ's have already spoken out about the issue and even some have announced that they are going to be done performing due to where the scene is headed. So please, can we breathe some life back into the scene?

10474,Just my 2 cents on the EDM scene,"I remember getting into this whole ""EDM"" craze about 3 years ago, (and yes, I realize I am still fairly new to the whole scene)  but what I have seen happen in those three years to the culture, and just about everything surrounding electronic dance music as a whole has been devastating to the point where I feel compelled enough to write this. I can confidently say that I began to listen to electronic music a little before the ""wave"" came into the states of it going mainstream seeing as I was one of the few people in my group of friends that listened to it, and I used to get made fun of for putting it on at parties. Little did I know what would happen with the future of the music i grew to love. 

That's where I began to notice the first problem.

Every time I would go out, I be forced to listen to one of your mainstream Top 40 DJ's and also have to listen to a group of proclaimed followers blathering about how they love ""Dj Avicii"" or ""Dj Swedish House Mafia."" When really those were the only 2 edm artists that they knew. I hate their music, but I was going to keep my mouth shut because I guessed it was cool that some people were starting to notice EDM in SOME way. (even if it was commercialized mainstream pop crap.) 

That's where the madness began. 

	Another year goes by, and I had already been through my wave of shows, concerts, and summer music festivals so I got the whole idea of what the culture was like (from being in Chicago). I had slaved myself in my friends room producing music day in and day out because I love electronic music, making music, and the changing shifts of new genres emerging every couple months. In that amount of time is when everyone else around me also caught on to the craze. I'm saying this in a bad way either like ""oh I liked it before anyone else did"" or ""you're all a bunch of band wagoners for liking it"" because lets face it, it is really good music. Even my mom and sister like some of it, and they only listen to whatever's on the local country radio stations. It has just come to a point where I feel that the whole ""Electronic Dance Music"" scene isn't really about the ""music"" anymore in the eyes of (most of) our generation.

	I see people that I know spending 100+ dollars to go to a show at the Congress Theatre in Chicago on artists that I honestly would never spend over 25 dollars to see even if i had liked them. For what? there's gonna be the EXACT same show the next month at the exact same venue. All the people in our generation have this idea planted in their minds where they cannot miss out on anything that their friends are doing or that anyone else around them is doing because they can't stand to be the one on the outside looking in. Sure, it's a bad feeling but these ""concerts"" are not something that come around once in a blue moon either. They really just want to go so they can get fucked up on drugs with their posse and ""rage"" out. Yes, I also understand that Extacy and all these drugs were apart of the whole ""Rave Scene"" in the 90's but that was when it was a very small group of people in a counter culture. Now even my 14 year old neighbor knows what ""molly"" is. It has gotten so ridiculous to the point where one cannot be associated without the other. Every event I go to (which is hardly ever anymore) I am amazed by the amounts of shirts and hats with drug references and the amount of people I hear only talking about drug use and what drugs they're on.

Give trap a year of growth and now every dubstep/moombahton producer is just putting out TRAP. I cant stand seeing this happen. Trap is great, but only so many artists do it well. Every song is the same drums, same sound, and the lack of originality is just as bad most EDM right now.  Do you guys think trap is here to stay? Or will it burn out and move on to the next fad?

Nowadays, it seems 60% of the song you hear on pop radio incorporate some aspect of electronic music, be it a bass drop or simply a vocoder effect on the voice(think of taylor swifts ""trouble""). It doesnt matter if the artist makes hip-hop, pop, indie, rock, EVERYONE is using electro influences now and i love it.


i for one am really glad that our kind of music is finally being accepted on the radio, what do you guys think?

10570,Behind the scenes of the biggest EDM party in the world (Electric Daisy Carnival 2012 Video),"https://vimeo.com/57695672


A dynamic behind the scenes look at the EDC experience from the VJ perspective.


Last year, I followed [V Squared Labs](http://vsquaredlabs.com/) from Los Angeles to Las Vegas to Insomniac's Electric Daisy Carnival.


We begin in the lab, where the artists are creating their 3D animations, binding their midi controllers and preparing stage designs for one of the biggest parties in the world.


Over 300,000 people attend the Electric Daisy Carnival annually.


Next we're in Las Vegas at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway watching the constructors build what was to be the largest stage in North America. 3-4 days later, the LED walls were up and the VJ's were ready to plug in their midi controllers and computers.


The most complicated stage was the Bassrush stage. Vello Virkhaus and his team used two 32,000 lumen projectors stacked one on top of the other, running with 2 computers and 2 outputs from each computer. 


""We've produced content they had developed from the ideal viewpoint of the audience to see perspecitval illusion in this space. The idea is illusion and transformation.""


Hours of planning, Days of filming, Weeks of editing, Minutes of your enjoyment.

I've never heard of this guy before and I didn't have anything going on for the night so I took up his offer. Everyone in the crowd was having a blast enjoying themselves while said DJ was sulking the entire time. After our set the crowd pretty much died out and wasn't vibing to his music.

My friend and I were waiting for his ""promoter"" to come through and pay us the money - I had somewhere to be around two am and I couldn't bother waiting around. I asked him to text his friend so we can get paid. Dude turns into a tyrant because I wouldn't close his set for him (lol) and then he proceeds to push me. I look over to my friend confused as to what just happened, so instead of pushing him back I told security what happened, fortunately they witnessed the event. Security confronts this over conceited douchebag and he claims that I attempted to headbutt him.

They shut off the music and he touches me again, I push him into the wall because at this point I'm pretty fucking furious. Security comes and he tries to run out of the club and catch a cab. One of the promoters ended up giving me $20 to cab home with my stuff, when I leave the club hes outside with his friends talking to management.

10644,Accepting Guest Mix Submissions For New EDM Podcast,"Hello gang!


I have been producing ""Electronic Education"" EDM Music segments for almost a year now on The Eviscerated Gaming Podcast (http://Eviscerated.net).  Basically, I either highlight a live mix I've made or I feature a specific genre of EDM for the week's session and do a mix of selected tracks within that genre.  The segment basically started out as the anchor to end each episode of our gaming podcast, designed to enlighten and educate listeners about the styles of music that I enjoy.


The segments and mixes have been accepted very well, and I've now decided to take the show from a segment to a full stand alone EDM DJ Mix Show podcast under the name The Electronic Education Podcast, which will be featured on iTunes &amp; Stitcher Radio.  


I'm still working on building the website home for the podcast, which can be found at http://edmdjmixshow.com , but I am also in search of some DJs to be featured as guest mixes on the episodes.


The new format will include 30 minute guest mixes that are submitted by DJs like you, bedrooms DJs, and lesser known DJs looking for new listeners.  All styles of EDM mixes are welcome as I will be promoting the many varieties of EDM genres.


I would love to hear what you have to share!


Full DJ Mix Submission Guidelines can be found on the site:
http://edmdjmixshow.com/submission-guidelines



I'm looking at launching the first episode in April (on the year anniversary of our gaming podcast), so you have plenty of time to get something recorded and submitted.

Hope you have something to share with us all!  This will be a great resume builder and will be pretty sweet to hear your mix aired on our show!  Let's spread some good vibes and good tunes to the world!

10768,Anyone have a good recommendation for quality headphones?,"I should note first, I use my headphones every day while I'm at work.  Also, I'm not just sitting at my desk.  I'm usually on my feet the whole time, so portability is a huge factor.  However, I work in a warehouse with a lot of loud noises, so while I don't necessarily need ""noise cancelling"" headphones, a pair that can block out a lot of sound is a must.  In-ears tend to hurt my ears and I've never found a pair loud enough to block out the air compressor in our warehouse.

Now, for my history with headphones.
I've jumped all over the place with headphones and haven't found anything worthwhile.  I had a pair of Bose over-ear (I forget the actual name - 4 years ago, they ran about $150).  Those were great for the sound quality, but I quickly wore through the wires to the point where only one speaker produced sound.  Bose wouldn't do anything with the warranty, so I jumped ship to Beats Solos.  Those were decent sound quality, but ultimately not worth the price.  Also, same thing, I kept burning through wires (although, those were easily replaceable).  After about 3 months with those, I sold them to a friend to help finance some SkullCandy SkullCrushers.  These are by far the worst of the 3 that I've owned.  I've had them for 1 month and just can't stand them anymore.  The cord has this huge brick attached to it called the ""Bass Amplified Subwoofer"".  Yea, it sucks.  It's constantly in the way and the extra bass sounds like crap.  Oh yea, the speakers are already blown too.  

So, I turn to you, oh knowledgeable Redditors.  Where should I look now?

First, I'm using the standard 14"" acrylic globe for the head.  Most people use a Dremel rotary saw to cut the mouth and eye openings.  I unfortunately do not have access to a Dremel.  Has anyone used other means to cut?  I'm planning on trying to use an exacto knife (razors) or a drill and a jigsaw, however the jigsaw is iffy considering it is not a flat surface.

Second, I'm using an extruded polystyrene styrofoam for the ears but am planning to paint the entire head rather than covering with fabric.  I'm using a basic white gloss spray paint that is a mixture of primer and final paint and then covering it with glow in the dark paint.  Will the paint melt or distort the styrofoam?  Should I cover the ears with papier mache or something before painting?

For past few weeks, i've been bumping into this brilliant remix from Xilent (much better than the ""excision original"")

it got me wondering, as Ben sage - Sleepless is one of my all time favorite tunes (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nunrp9Tqot0), and was released ages before the excision remix of this song was.

So, shouldn't the below Excision song be called Ben sage - Sleepless (excision remix), instead of Excision - sleepless ?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG1-5Zop8PM

When and how did a Ben Sage song become excision song? Shouldn't the original ben sage works be given some credits somewhere?

This is very confusing, any comments which might shed light on this are appreciated!

So what's going to change? 

I will no longer be doing the weekly news EDM every wednesday. Instead you can visit [Youredm.com](http://Youredm.com) (which is where I work now :D and it's a shameless plug, I know, but it's a really great site!) for all the latest and greatest in EDM. We also have a [Facebook Page](http://facebook.com/Youredm) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/YourEDM) that would be super easy to just get updates on what you love. 
If you see a post on YourEDM that you like, don't be afraid to share it here or with your friends : ) 

**I will still be doing the producer spotlight!!** I'll ask submissions from all of our producers on Sunday (CDT) and announce the Producer Spotlight for the Week! 

Also, most if not all of the articles that I write personally, I will be submitting them here. I've had great response on my first article, which was the Zedd- Clarity review and others as well : ) 
**if there is anything you see that is wrong or even if it's just a comment on my writing ( constructive criticism would be awesome) I would appreciate the help!**

You know that I love all of you, and your the best subreddit community a moderator could ask for, so all that I ask is that if you could please continue growing /r/edm, so that we could all enjoy the music we love to hear&lt;3 

**if I left something out, or you have questions for me, just comment down below!** : )

It hadn't occurred to me that techno is a sub-genre and not the proper name for the whole genre of music. 

I learned the proper name after referring to several songs as techno and then getting a very severe backlash from electronic aficionados. With my exploration of EDM I've come to enjoy many of the sub-genres, but their names have never really become important to me. I usually just refer to everything as EDM. 

So how do you guys deal with this? It seems like there are so many EDM sub-genres that it's  impossible to remember them all. Also, do you find it easy to discern most sub-genres from eachother? It's easy for some (DnB or Dubstep) but not so easy for others.

* Fake Blood 
* Steve Aoki
* Toxic Avenger   
* Barletta
* Drop the Lime - would like to find more
* F.O.O.L.
* Autoerotique - want more
* Tocadisco - need more

The songs will be chosen according to upvotes and a max of 20 songs will be chosen( keeps the file small and able to easily share and distribute.)  
**post will be open until the second sunday in the month** after that the mix should be up shortly after : )

2. Monthly EDM DJ.
-*this is for you all trying to get your name out there* Every month we'll have 1 post (Monthly DJ Entry!) where you will either upload your mix to Youtube, Soundcloud, or any other apparatus where users can easily view, listen, and rate the mix. **Entries must be submitted through a link and in the comments of the post in order to be counted.** I will also have a youtube channel and twitter in order to advise those that want to enter to well.. ENTER! 

and that's about it for now, thanks for reading everyone!

10987,FEED ME's take on music and art:  Motivation,"This is what artists should be about.  FEED ME:

&gt;'This is the greatest game in the world.'

&gt;I've almost stopped doing interviews because I'm achieving nothing. If you want to find something out about me, ask me personally. If it catches my eye, I'll respond, but dragging through another interview that no one thought about for more than two minutes seems like treading very boring water. Not that they've all been that way; but it's the trend.

&gt;A well known electronic music magazine recently wanted to do a few page spread about my production techniques. They sent me a list of preliminary questions; what plugins do I use for 'dirty' sounds, what makes a good 'drop', how much 'filth is too much filth'? Who wrote this? I could play the system; give away minimal information in exchange for some printed coverage, but at this point, fuck it. The Mau5hax thing was great; I got to interface with talented people and enjoy making music. I learnt as well as got involved. I didn't sit and have my mechanical techniques picked at while my actual motivation was ignored; we made decisions together.

&gt;I don't mind the occasional production Q, but what happened to mystery in music and art? There's YouTube tutorials for days now online. Look it up; these production conversations are redundant. The truth and effect comes in the sincerity and composition of the actual piece. If I read an interview with an artist of any type, what I want to know is the 'why' - not the 'how'. Why as electronic artists are we constricted to being quizzed monotonously about our techniques, and not ever our motivation? The reason anything I made sounds the way it did is because I sat and worked out every single piece of it myself. Give every one of us the same tools, and see what we all end up with - it's our differences in expression and decision making that makes us.

&gt;I'm doing this because I honestly don't know what else I can do. Music and art for me is a necessary release, and once people picked up on what I was making I was thrown into it. I was a bottled up, angry teenager, and I was completely consumed by the satisfaction I'd found in this new idea of making my own music. It consumed my life and I found I loved what it brought to it, and now I'm on an endless journey to see where it takes me, and where I can take it. Because of it, my entire late teenage and adult life I've been travelling the world, from Spor to Feed Me, constantly humbled by the people I've met, things I've seen, extremes I've lived through - I'm nothing but overwhelmingly grateful, it's almost too much.

&gt;Some of it has been physically and mentally tough, but so far I've never quit. It's never left my mind that should I drop dead, there's a million people who would kill to take my place. I don't believe in luck necessarily; I carved this out myself, but I am honoured to have what I have. If you're going to complain about your reality when you're living another persons dream, then I think you need a massive reality check. No one's forcing you. Music is magic; and I think as artists we have a duty to keep it that way, not dissolve it down into presets, complaints, one-upmanship and catering to the market. It's not all pink candy-floss cloud rides, and I think it looks fake if you depict it that way, but it really could be a lot fucking worse.

&gt;I used to lie and listen to my favourite records and daydream about how they were thought up, get lost in the sounds. There was no one to ask or study, and the resulting domino effect of speculation led me to my own ideas. It's always been the unknown that's motivated me. Spor was what I fell in to, but Feed Me is my world, a projection of a piece of me, and a way of expressing whatever I feel like. I couldn't have built what I have without you guys supporting me, but I'll always be creating and writing it none the less. I love you all for letting me take it this far.

&gt;I don't normally post my opinions on here, but I've never got anywhere by playing the game, and sometimes I just feel I need to 1) say thanks, and 2) say why. TLDR.

11008,"A few ideas for r/EDM. How does New Music Mondays and Awesome Show Fridays sound? Also, other ideas! ","NMM would include a video or link submission to music that either has come out in that month, or even music that's going to be released next month!(Even if it's a clip, if it's awesome then post it!) All videos will be reader submitted! That means you guys get to submit all the new music you can find! :D 

As for ASF, if there are any local shows or even big events such as EDC going on then let everyone know about it! I think it would be nice to put it in the format such as:

Where: 
When:
Artist(s):
Age requirement(if any):
Cost:

We could also post a link to whatever social media the artist or event's use to keep up with them and so we could keep enjoying the music!

What do you guys think? :D 

I was also thinking that if it's either a NMM post or ASF post to put it in a bracket at the end of the title? So for example, 

EDC returns to Las Vegas 2012! Hundreds of artists! Are you going? [ASF]

11009,xpost from r/burningman: List of Electronic Music Festivals,"Soooo, I got told to come over here, anyone know of other EDM festivals happening this summer?


There's been a few threads along these lines recently, but I wanted to group a listing together to make it easier to learn about other festivals that may make good alternatives to burning man. I did not get tickets, and my other local big festival (Shambhala) has sold out also, so I'm trying to figure out festival alternatives (because I'll be damned if I don't go to anything this summer...)
 

I've tried to gleam all the info I could from others' posts, about date, location, and links to the websites. Any help in expanding this list would be much appreciated!

11018,Twobit - Cold [Listen/critique - please!],"Heya folks,

I tried putting this to /r/trance and /r/reasoners for some feedback, but haven't heard anything back on it yet. Well, one kind soul gave me an opinion and suggestions, which I took in to account. It was greatly appreciated.

I figured I'd post it here in /r/edm to see if anyone would mind giving some feedback on it.

[Heres the soundcloud link direct to the track](http://soundcloud.com/twobit-2/twobit-cold-extended-mix)

I guess the genre is trance or some variation on it. I usually write with a couple of daws, depending on what I'm going for, but this one is done in Reason 5 only. No sampling, just a load of synths I've knocked up recently (which is what it started out as, just a load of combinators I was making). Arpeggios took forever to write as I'm not keen on the Reason Arp system. Just multiple note lanes.

I don't think it's my best track, (my personal fav is Cariad (Odyssey) on my profile) but I was going for an oldschool feel a little like art of trance which I _think_ comes across.

Anyway, I'd love some feedback. The good, the bad, the ugly. It's not the first time I've submitted something, so I have thick enough skin.

Cheers for your time,
Huw
